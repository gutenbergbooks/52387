<h2 class="p4">PREFACE</h2>

<p class="pn2"><span class="smcap">In</span> Italy the poems of Gabriele Rossetti have enjoyed a
large amount of celebrity, and they are still held in honoured
remembrance; his prose works are there known rather by
rumour than in perusal. In England the case of the prose
works is much the same, while the poems are as good as unknown.
His life has never been written on any very complete
scale. In Italian there are some Memoirs, more or less
detailed and accurate&mdash;perhaps the most solid is that written
by my cousin Teodorico Pietrocola-Rossetti; in English, the
nearest approach to an account of him may be what appears
in the course of my <i>Memoir of Dante Gabriel Rossetti</i> (1895).
There is also some important information in the book, <i>John
Hookham Frere and his Friends</i>, mentioned on p. 132 of the
present volume.</p>

<p>The name of Gabriele Rossetti has in this country secured
some amount of respectful regard, but rather on adventitious
than on strictly personal grounds. He is contemplated in his
paternal relation&mdash;the father of Dante Gabriel and Christina
Rossetti. Dr Garnett, in his <i>History of Italian Literature</i>,
has expressed the point neatly, and in terms stronger than
it would behove me to use: “Rossetti assuredly will not be
forgotten by England, for which he has done what no other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
inhabitant of these isles ever did, in begetting two great
poets.”</p>

<p>On me it can be no less than a filial obligation to do what
I can for the memory of my patriotic, highly gifted, laborious,
and loving father. I therefore offer to the British public
the following authentic record of him, and leave it to obtain
such readers as it may.</p>

<h2 class="p4" id="c001">GABRIELE ROSSETTI</h2>

<p class="pn2"><span class="smcap">As</span> the career of Gabriele Rossetti was much mixed
up with political and dynastic events in the Kingdom
of Naples (or of the Two Sicilies), it may be as well
at starting to give a very brief <i>résumé</i> of historical
facts.</p>

<p>In the year 1734 the Kingdom of Naples, in the resettlement
of Europe consequent upon the Treaty of
Utrecht, was under the dominion of the Empire, or,
as we should now word it, of Austria; but in that
year an almost bloodless conquest brought-in a different
dynasty. Charles, Duke of Parma, a son of
the Bourbon King of Spain, Philip V., by his second
wife Elizabeth Farnese, a spirited youth only seventeen
years of age, determined to assert his ancestral
claims upon the kingdom, and in a trice he was firmly
seated upon the Neapolitan throne. His government,
though in a sense despotic, was popular and enlightened.
In 1759 he became by succession King of
Spain; and, under the obligation of existing treaties,
he relinquished the Kingdom of Naples to his third<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
son, Ferdinand, aged only eight. In 1768 Ferdinand
married Maria Caroline, daughter of the Emperor
Francis and of Maria Theresa, and sister of Marie
Antoinette.</p>

<p>Ferdinand IV., as he was then termed (afterwards
Ferdinand I.) was a man of no great ability, but of
vigorous physique, and sufficiently well-disposed as
a sovereign; his wife, strong-minded and domineering,
was the more active governor of the two, and promoted
various innovations, some of which fairly counted as reforms.
Things went on well enough for the rulers and
the subjects until the outbreak of the French Revolution
in 1789, when Neapolitan opposition to France and
all things French became pronounced. Queen Caroline
naturally did not relish the decapitation of her sister
in 1793, and hostilities against the Republic ensued.
In 1798 the king decamped to Sicily, and in the
following year his continental dominions became the
“Parthenopean Republic.” This was of short duration,
January to June 1799. The Southern provinces rose
in arms, under the leadership of Cardinal Ruffo; the
French army departed, and Ferdinand was re-installed
in Naples&mdash;Lord Nelson, victorious from the Battle
of the Nile, playing a large part, and a much-debated
one, in this transaction. Ferdinand now ruled with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
great rigour, and committed some barbaric acts of
repression and retaliation, for which his consort was
regarded as gravely responsible. The great Napoleon,
Consul, Emperor, and King of Italy, was not likely to
tolerate for long the anti-French severities, demonstrations,
and intrigues, of “il Rè Nasone,” as Ferdinand
was nicknamed in virtue of his portentously long and
prominent nose. Early in 1806 Ferdinand and Caroline
disappeared once more into Sicily, under British
protection, and Joseph Bonaparte was enthroned in
Naples. Joseph, in 1808, was transferred to the Spanish
kingdom; and Joachim Murat, brother-in-law of
Napoleon and of Joseph by his marriage with their
sister Caroline, reigned in Naples in his stead. Ferdinand,
with the other Caroline, remained meanwhile
unattackable in Sicily, and was turned into a constitutional
king there by British predominance. In
1815, on the final collapse of the Napoleonic <i>régime</i>,
and very shortly after the death of his Queen, he
returned to Naples.</p>

<p>These particulars, meagre as they are, seem to be
sufficient to show what was the historical background
to the fortunes of Gabriele Rossetti, with whom alone
I am directly concerned. He was born under a
recently-established dynasty, in a kingdom of despotic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
rule and many relics of feudalism; from the age
of twenty-three to thirty-two he was the subject of
a new and intrusive dynasty, not less despotic, but
free from all trammels inherited from the past. Then
in 1815 he again came under the old system, but in
a state of public feeling and aspiration which rapidly
led to a constitutional government, sworn to by
the sovereign, and abolished by him at the first
opportunity.</p>

<p>I propose to relate my father’s life in his own verse
as translated by me, supplemented by a little of my
prose. It was towards the year 1850, when his general
health and strength had grievously decayed, and he
was conscious of the imminent approaches of death,
that he composed a versified autobiography, of which
the great majority is here embodied. He wrote it in
rhymed sextets; but I, for ease and literality, have
rendered it into blank verse. His own verse is, as
he himself acknowledges, here pitched in a very subdued
key, with little endeavour after poetic elevation;
though there are some passages in a higher strain.
My translation makes still less pretension as poetry;
it conveys the sense with strict accuracy, and that is
all it affects. My father retained in his old age some
of the habits of “poetic diction” which had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
customary in the Italy of his youth; and one finds
here more than one quite wants of Phœbus, Neptune,
Minerva’s fane, and other “rattle-traps of mythology”
(to borrow a phrase from William Blake); in all this
I follow my original. The versification of the Italian
text is often ingenious, and even masterly; abounding
in dactylic line-endings, or <i>rime sdrucciole</i>, as the
Italians call them&mdash;a difficult feat, at which Rossetti
was uncommonly deft. I have given the great bulk
of the production&mdash;which, indeed, I had in the first
instance translated in full; but eventually I thought
some passages here and there, and also some amplifications
of phrase, useless for the purposes of the British
reader, and have therefore excluded them. The whole
of the expressly biographical matter is preserved.
Those notes which are not marked by an initial are
my father’s own; those to which “W.” is appended
are mine&mdash;there being several points which seemed to
need some explanation.</p>

<p>My material does not call for much division or subdivision.
I shall therefore simply separate it into the
Life of Gabriele Rossetti (his full Christian names were
Gabriele Pasquale Giuseppe) in Italy, and his Life in
Exile, Malta and England; and, plunging at once
into the versified autobiography, I commence the</p>

<p class="pp6 p1">I know my fame will have but scanty flight,<br />
Readers to whom I speak of Italy.<br />
Yet, if in any of you there rose a wish<br />
To know me who I am, I’ll meet it here.<br />
Ovid’s own native soil is mine as well:<br />
He spoke about himself, and so will I.<br />
In verses Ovid wrote, but I in prose&mdash;<br />
Prose of eleven syllables with rhymes;<br />
But, be they verses, I shall not contest.<br />
And, without more preamble, hear me now.</p>

<p class="pp6 p1">Along the beach of the Frentani lies<br />

A small municipality of Rome&mdash;<br />
Histonium once and Vasto now ’tis called.<br />
There, with no waft of Fortune, I received<br />
A humble cradle from a worthy pair.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p class="p1">The brief statement of my father, in his verses and
his note, may be slightly extended. Nicola Rossetti
was a blacksmith and locksmith; his wife, Maria Francesca<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
Pietrocola, was the daughter of a shoemaker. Both
families seem to have held a creditable, though certainly
a by no means distinguished, position in the small
Vastese community. The original name of the Rossetti
race (as I have heard my father more than once affirm)
was not Rossetti but Della Guardia. Some babies
in the Della Guardia family were born with red or
reddish hair (I presume, four or five generations before
my father’s birth); and the Vastese&mdash;who, like other
Italians, never lose a chance of calling people by
nicknames&mdash;termed them “the Rossetti”&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> “The
Little Reds,” and this continued to serve as surname
for their progeny. Thus the surname Rossetti may
be regarded as equivalent to the English surname
Reddish, or Rudkins (if Rudkins is an abbreviation
of Ruddykins). The family of Della Guardia still
exists in Vasto. It appears to have been entitled to
bear a crest&mdash;which is a sturdy-looking tree, with the
motto “Frangas non flectas”; for a seal (still in my
possession), showing this crest and motto, was delivered
to Gabriele Rossetti, on his quitting Vasto in youth,
by his elder brother the Canon Andrea, who told
him that it was the family-device. This was often
used, I may add, by Dante Gabriel Rossetti. It
appears that in the Rossetti line, or else in the Della<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
Guardia line, there must have been some degree of
literary eminence prior to the date of the blacksmith
Nicola; as I find, in a letter addressed by Gabriele
Rossetti, towards 1807, to his elder brother Domenico,
the phrase: “You know that our stock has always
abounded in great men of letters.” One cannot suppose
that this statement is a mere fib: I have not,
however, found any confirmation of it in books about
Vasto, nor do I remember that my father ever referred
to such a matter by word of mouth.</p>

<p>I believe that Nicola Rossetti came to his end in
a distressing way. When the French Republican army
invaded the Neapolitan territory in 1798, the troops
required Nicola to render some service, such as horseshoeing,
provisioning, transport, or what not. He
showed no inclination to comply, and was beaten or
otherwise ill-treated; and this so preyed on his mind
that his health suffered, and death ensued. His decease
may, I presume, have occurred towards 1800;
his widow survived till 1822 or some such date.
Gabriele Rossetti used to speak with much affection
of his mother, who (like so many Italian women of
the lower middle class in those days) could neither
write nor read. He remembered his father as a somewhat
harsh man, but upright and worthy of respect.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
The Rossetti family is now wholly extinct, save
in the persons of myself and my four children;
the line of my father’s married sisters is also extinct.</p>

<p>The precise date of my father’s birth was 28th
February 1783 (not 1st March, as has at times been
written and printed). He was born in a lofty brown
building, which, in a water-colour with which I was
favoured towards the date of the Vastese centenary celebration
of his birth, wears a somewhat stately though
wholly unadorned aspect. It looks like an edifice
which has stood for some centuries, solid but uncared
for. It is now, I understand, a dilapidated structure,
let out in tenements to a poor class of people. The
question of buying it for the city of Vasto, in memory
of Gabriele Rossetti, has often been mooted, but not
carried into effect. There are prophets who have no
honour in their own country; and others who, rather
profusely honoured there by word of mouth, are left
in the lurch when deeds and subscriptions are in
demand.</p>

<p class="pp6 p1">In the first opening years of joyousness<br />
I showed clear sign of studious aptitude;<br />
And, following my brothers, three in count,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>Whose lively parts had been in evidence,<br />
I was escorted by this goodly three<br />

<p class="pp6 p1">Thrilled by the first Phœbean impulses,<br />
Rough versicles I traced with facile hand:<br />
And yet, to my surprise, those lines of mine<br />
Almost took wing into a distant flight.<br />
A hope of Pindus did I hear me named:<br />
But praise increased my ardour, not my pride.<br />
And yet some vanity there came and mixed<br />
With the fair issue of my preluding:<br />
But, all the more I heard the applause increase,<br />
With equal force did study grow in me.<br />
Not surely that I tried to load my page<br />
With pomp abstruse extraneous to my drift;<br />
But counterwise each image and each rhyme,<br />
The more spontaneous, so meseemed more fair.<br />
In trump of gold and in the oaten pipe<br />
Let some seek the sublime, I seek for ease.<br />
I shunned those verses which sprawl forth untuned<br />
Even from my days of schoolboy tutelage:<br />
I know they please some people, but not me:<br />
Admiring Dante, Metastasio<br />
I laud; and hold&mdash;a true Italian ear<br />
Must not admit one inharmonious verse.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>Some lines require a very surgeon’s hand<br />
To make them upon crutches stand afoot.<br />
So be they! But, to set them musical,<br />
They must, by Heaven, be in themselves a song.<br />
This seems a truthful, not a jibing, rule&mdash;<br />
Music and lyric are a twinborn thing.<br />
Yet think not that I deem me satisfied<br />
With upblown empty sound without ideas:&mdash;<br />
Then will a harmony be beautiful<br />
When great emotions and great thoughts it stirs.</p>

<p class="pp6 p1">To painting with an equal ardency<br />
An almost sudden impulse led me on;<br />
And with the pen I drew in such a mode<br />
That all my work would look as if engraved.<br />
To question what I say would nothing serve,<br />
For on my hands more than one proof remains.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a><br />
A plaining ditty which describes my state,<br />
And wherein I deplore my fate perverse,<br />

By me his memory must be always blest),<br />
Being once in company with men of mark<br />
Whom he was wont to invite from time to time,&mdash;<br />
My verses read by him, and drawings seen&mdash;<br />
Felt pleased that I was of his vassalage;<br />

And bidding him to send me on to Naples.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a><br />

There I was patronized, without parade,<br />
By him, who from the first received me well:<br />
But little did that firm support endure,<br />
For a political whirlwind cut it short.<br />
Poor I&mdash;how fare in a vast capital?<br />
I had to bow before my destinies.<br />
For scarcely had a year and month elapsed,<br />
In which new studies occupied my mind,<br />
When the French army of invasion came<br />
In the sixth year of this our century,&mdash;<br />
And, seeking Sicily in urgent flight,<br />

<p class="pp6 p1">On saddened brows a few, and many glad,<br />
I read the souls of men enslaved or free:<br />
And, mixed myself ’mid such conflicting minds,<br />
Judge you if I was joyful or was grieved.<br />
The festive thundering of the martial forts<br />
Responded to by frequent trumpet-call,<br />
Cheers that were uttered by a thousand mouths<br />
As the tricoloured banner came in view,<br />
And hurly-burly weltering all around,<br />
Opposed enormous joy to enormous grief.<br />
Yet thoughts, more than enough, ominous and black,<br />
Whispered me somewhile ’mid those shouts of joy:<br />
“My hapless country, what dost thou acclaim,<br />
Now that one despot goes and one arrives?<br />
Ah on thy shoulders still I find the yoke:<br />
They doff the old one and they don the new.”<br />
And from my heart the words leapt to my lips:<br />
“To call this liberty were sure a jibe!<br />
As Ferdinand in Naples stifled her,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>So Bonaparte butchered her in France.<br />
But tremble, tremble, impious man! Thy crime<br />
On all the nations’ hearts stands written deep.”</p>

<p class="pp6 p1">I was a prophet here. Germany in arms,<br />

By Liberty he rose, by her he fell.<br />
France in my youthful fervency I loved,<br />
I loved the awful warrior guiding her:<br />
But, when I heard, “He’s made an Emperor now,<br />
Nor that alone, but despot autocrat,”<br />
The hate I felt extinguished all that fire.</p>

<p class="pp6 p1">For many ’twas a cause of deepest grief<br />
To contemplate with golden diadem<br />
A brother of that despot on our throne.<br />
His praise was&mdash;having turned the Bourbon out;<br />
Whence, setting every other thought at rest,<br />
They all applauded him, and so did I.<br />
A chosen band of daring souls and brave<br />
Encircled the incoming Frenchman round,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a><br />
And of two evils they acclaimed the less,<br />

Round the new sceptre flocking now I marked<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>A crowd of shining minds, and joyed herein;<br />
And, taking up the lyre resolvedly,<br />
Inly I said: “A poet I was born,<br />
And such I will be in my future course!”<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a><br />

To follow in that movement&mdash;and alas!<br />
From the successive shiftings of the chance,<br />
I, loving good, saw evil that ensued.<br />
Across the Red Sea, sea of blood and war,<br />
Must then the Promised Land be still approached?<br />
That fatal whirlwind, with alternate shock,<br />
In Naples’ kingdom all-deplorable<br />
Full ten times made a change of government,<br />
Alternating with serfdom liberty:<br />
And, with the flight of that demented court,<br />
I saw it for the fourth time altering:<br />
And the ninth change and tenth, which now I see,<br />
Are the most miserable of them all.</p>

<p class="pp6 p1">Many gave homage to the new-built throne;<br />
And I, while scorning any cringing phrase,<br />
Struck on my lyre, and spread abroad its sound,<br />
Saluting that forthcoming period:<br />
And what I said thereof in varying style,<br />
If not free-toned, is not subservient.<br />
Soon do the accents of my lyre recall<br />
Men’s eyes and praises to the youthful gift,<br />
And I diffuse the firstlings of my fame<br />
About the kingdom’s mighty capital;<br />
But, by attracting blear-eyed rivals too,<br />
Envy first made me a target for her darts.<br />
And so much did this trouble my repose,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>And raised hobgoblins such a swarm at home,<br />
That, freed from them, my dolorous exile<br />

<p class="pp6 p1">Ah when I think it o’er I shudder still,<br />
Though past the sixtieth limit of my years.<br />
One Boccanera, livid in his rage,<br />

Watchful I had to be for several months:<br />
Can then insensate envy reach to this?<br />
But who can tell all the contorted roads<br />
Which rancour led my rivals to pursue?<br />
Charges unjust, anonymous calumnies,&mdash;<br />
But yet my innocence o’erthrew them all:<br />
Intrepid I outfaced such keen attacks,<br />
And became known and cherished by the young.<br />
In public halls, where it behoved me at times<br />
To speak the verses I had written down,<br />
The popular applause served to prelude<br />
My song, as soon as I appeared in sight.</p>

How much I joyed that on that stately stage<br />
My mind was thus allowed to spatiate!<br />
“In this arena of glory,” I would say,<br />
“If I have genius, I can show it forth”;<br />
And dreamed of mingling in one dulcet draught<br />
Alfieri’s style with Metastasio’s.<br />
But my illusions waned; for various thwarts,<br />
And fetters both direct and indirect,<br />
And the composers and the Managers,<br />
And Prime Donne, plots, and etiquettes,<br />
And then protectors and aught stranger still,<br />
Frequently shuffled all my hand of cards.<br />
Incensed I cried: “I’ll leave the Theatre,<br />
For here I’m nothing but a slave of slaves.”</p>

<p class="pp6 p1">To Monsignor Capecelatro I sped,<br />
Our Minister at the time for Home-affairs,<br />
And meekly spoke, expounding first the facts,<br />
“The Madhouse is not where I want to go.”<br />
Could vanity from sovereign patronage<br />
Dazzle a free Parnassian intellect?<br />
I was content with a subordinate post<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a><br />
Then vacant in the King’s Museum; here<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>Propitious did the Muses nurture me<br />
With vivid genius of the antique arts.<br />
Here I could pasture in the selfsame hour<br />
My craving mind, and shelter it from vice,<br />
For an immense choice library is joined<br />
To the Museum, in one building’s span:<br />
And thus a double discipline exalts<br />
My soul in beauty’s pathways and in truth’s.<br />
’Mid living bronze and marble animate,<br />
Which constantly held converse with my thoughts,<br />
I something wrote in prose and much in verse,<br />
Evolving grace upon the fair and true.</p>

<p class="pp6 p1">Staying amid those admirable hoards,<br />
A treasure-house of arts and industries,<br />
I met with Kings and met with Emperors,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>Conspicuous artists, men of lettered fame.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a><br />
And thus three lustres of my term of life<br />
Wore in that unperturbed abode along;<br />
And I beheld two Kings arrive and go,<br />
Made and unmade by force of destiny.<br />
But, though my work was converse with the dead,<br />
I scanned both courts, their virtues and their vice.<br />
Of the two kings, one bad, and one was good,<br />
And in this sentence all is summarized;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>And both their fates depended, and their thrones,<br />
Upon the man who dreamed omnipotence;<br />
But by the Spanish and the Northern storm<br />
The star of Bonaparte turned to pale.<br />
Odious to many, Joseph went his way,&mdash;<br />
That silence followed him which speaks for much;<br />
Wasteful and lustful and vainglorious,<br />
He by his courtiers only was deplored.<br />
Better than Ferdinand he was for sure,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>But that was merit (merit!) none could miss.<br />
Later when Joachim of a sudden fled,<br />
I heard a general chorus of concern&mdash;<br />
“If but his mind were equal to his heart,<br />
Who worthier than he to fill a throne?”<br />
Ferdinand matched with him produces that<br />
Which in a picture gives the shades and lights.<br />
O epoch memorable for wretchedness!<br />
Oh the caprice of barbarous destiny<br />
Which sent us back that faithless Ferdinand,<br />
Bereaving us of kindly Joachim!<br />
And soon the craven to the valiant gave,<br />
By the same destiny, a barbarous death.</p>

<p class="pp6 p1">O Bonaparte, <i>thou</i> the object deemed<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>Of worship? Ah he lies who calls thee great!<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a><br />
For thee the world claims lofty intellect,<br />
For thee, with an enormous error fooled.<br />
Thou wast, in wresting from the nations hope,<br />
At once liberticide and suicide.<br />
That day when thou didst will thee Emperor,<br />
Thou in St Helena dugg’st out thy grave:<br />
That day thou gav’st back Austria all her strength,<br />
To Russia daring, potency to Kings.<br />
That edict which the applauding Senate brought<br />
To thee, ’twas that the edict of thy death.<br />
Well do I know how scheming sycophants<br />
Proclaimed the day auspicious and of joy;<br />
But that day sowed the mournfulness of years<br />
For thee and thine, for nations, for the world.<br />
And thou, of piercing sight, thou saw’st it not?<br />
By God, a mole would not have failed to see!<br />
For thee I weep not, who in long-drawn throes<br />
Didst reach convulsive to thy latest hour;<br />
But for the innocent nations weep I fain,<br />
Who, by thy hand betrayed, are moaning still.<br />
Ever have I been prone to pardoning thee<br />
Thy proper anguish, but not that of man.<br />
But for that crime by which thou didst indue<br />
Thee with vast shame and us with sorrows vast,<br />
How long ago would Europe have beheld,<br />
One after other, low her tyrants sunk!<br />
When I the effect contemplate of thy crime,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>I am tempted to exclaim&mdash;Be thou accurst!<br />
Receive the judgment of the centuries&mdash;<br />
I seem to hear it sounding o’er thy grave&mdash;<br />
“Thou couldst have been the tyrants’ death-dealer,<br />
And chosest for thyself a despot’s name.<br />
As the keen-cutting vengeful sword of God,<br />
Let wrong thou didst to others fall on thee!”</p>

<p class="pp6 p1">Now the Queen-city, Joachim being gone,<br />
Remained uncertain of her future fate;<br />
And, like death’s messenger, the cry arose&mdash;<br />
“Ferdinand hastens back, and Caroline”:<br />
And on a thousand gloomy brows one read<br />
More horror than for earthquake or the plague.<br />
And of those two the most terrific things<br />
I heard a hundred hundred tongues narrate.<br />
Some travelled, some escaped, some hid themselves,<br />
And one was known to have gone mad with fear:<br />
But hope, I saw, had halfway been revived<br />
When it was published&mdash;“Caroline is dead.”<br />
Yes, more than halfway; for they all averred:<br />
“This Bourbon, in himself, is weak and null;<br />
And, if he did become so black a wretch,<br />
’Twas that she-Fury who impelled him on:<br />
Now that she’s foundered in the realms of night,<br />
A human being he may be once more.”<br />
And so it proved. The first-imagined fears<br />
Were cleared away from the most troubled minds,<br />
And all perceived that on a better plan<br />
That richly-gifted Kingdom would be ruled,<br />
And would attain, under a milder curb,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>If not prosperity, at least repose.<br />
The Aonian chorus revelled in the peace,<br />
And chaunted amid others’ songs my own.<br />
Our Ferdinand the Fourth was just a fiend,<br />
But, dubbed the First, he wears an angel’s grace.<br />
And I beheld that festive ardour grow,<br />
The less expected, all the livelier.<br />
’Tis true so much rejoicing was perturbed,<br />
In almost every confine of the realm,<br />
By feverish epidemic, Noja’s plague,<br />
And, worst of all, a longsome year of dearth:<br />
But still the King dictated remedies,<br />
And, if he could no more, he sympathized.</p>

<p class="pp6 p1">Then, when he sickened, weighted now with years,<br />
And the severe disease seemed past a cure,<br />
So great the sorrow everywhere appeared<br />
That all the civil orders shared in it;<br />
And, when fair daylight followed on the cloud,<br />
The joy was equal to the genuine grief.<br />
In style now classic or romantic now<br />
Native Academies acclaim the event;<br />
And I, in verse extemporized almost<br />

Saluted, in the name of Italy,<br />

One Gallo (maybe Corvo?), of Sicily,<br />
Who thought himself a swan of Hippocrene&mdash;<br />
Or Gallo or Corvo, acrid and malign&mdash;<br />
Trying to do me an ill turn, did a good.<br />
And this affair I’m minded to narrate,&mdash;<br />
A curious little story as it is.<br />
He spread on all sides a censorious croak<br />
That my address was outrage ’gainst the King:<br />
And yet that ode contains such flatteries<br />
That, when I now reflect on it, I blush;<br />
And <i>he</i> discerned therein, and clamoured loud,<br />
An actual insult in the seeming praise.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a><br />
Against my verses such a cackle-cry<br />
Was raised by him on one and other hand<br />
That in the end our arbitrary Police<br />
Prohibited their printing in the book;<br />
And many said that I should find myself<br />
Dismissed my employ, or sent to jail perchance.<br />
The selfsame calumnies against my song,<br />
From quarters more than one, arrived in court.<br />
The King called for a copy, and, reading it,<br />
He was affected, and was moved to tears.<br />
The Duke of Ascoli was on the spot,<br />
Who with minuteness told me of the facts.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>Indeed the King so highly prized my lines<br />
That he directed the Home-Minister<br />
To have me summoned, and to give me thanks<br />
In a dispatch sent by the government:<br />
And, paper in hand, he added&mdash;“Tell him too,<br />
I wept at it, and feel indebted to him.”<br />
Further to crush that shameless calumny<br />
Which he remarked some people still believed,<br />
He made the Minister Tommasi read<br />
The poem aloud, in Council at the full,&mdash;<br />
And oh what plaudits did my lines secure!<br />
And at some parts the King shed tears anew.<br />
I, then at the Museum, saw arrive<br />
A Halberdier with grave and serious mien.<br />
Ah what uncertainties assailed my heart!<br />
Here comes the announcement that will strip me bare!<br />
I read, in doubt and wavering, the dispatch:<br />
“His Majesty requires you&mdash;come at once.”<br />
Anxious I sped, and pondered on the way<br />
What answer I could offer to the charge.<br />
I entered with that sinister forecast,<br />
And General Naselli, a Minister,<br />
Came forward and encountered me, all smiles.<br />
He said “Be seated”&mdash;pointing with his hand<br />
To a gilded sofa, face to face with him.<br />
He, turning with an affable regard<br />
Toward me, my eyebrows arching with surprise,<br />
Repeats, with manifest complacency,<br />
The kindly words used by the Sovereign:<br />
And on my countenance he could observe,<br />
Mingled with pleasure, some astonishment.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>I answered&mdash;after a simple preluding<br />
With which I need not here concern myself&mdash;<br />
“This moment compensates for studious years,&mdash;<br />
I’m thankful for the kindness of our King.<br />
But, Sir, is any power above his own?<br />
What he so much approves others reject.”<br />
He answered me with an offended air&mdash;<br />
“Have you your senses? This I can’t excuse.”<br />
And I: “The whole collection is in print,<br />
And my one poem only turned adrift;<br />
My senses serve me well, your Excellency:<br />
The Censorship has over-ruled the King.”<br />
He smiled, and then, in a laconic tone,<br />
Dictated to his secretary thus:<br />
“The poems all must pass the censorship,<br />
Except the one by Gabriel Rossetti.<br />
From his the printing cannot be withheld,<br />
Because the King has passed it and approved.”<br />
I showed about all this no great conceit,<br />
But it was greeted warmly by the young,<br />
And that Sicilian Gallo, envious man,<br />
Remained a laughing-stock, and drooped his comb.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a><br />
Then, when my lyric came to public light,<br />
It won in Naples universal praise.<br />
The fame of it went forth to Rome itself,<br />
Where I am proud of being amply known,<br />
For there I left a band of well-wishers<br />
When the Provisional Government dissolved<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>In which I unobtrusively had held<br />
In the Fine Arts a post of eminence.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a><br />
And the Sebezia Academy with pride<br />
Noted my victory, which involved its own,<br />
And which was viewed with so much bitterness<br />
By Gallo that he fled that very night.<br />
This Gallo against me, an exile now,<br />
Perhaps is crowing still&mdash;which I forgive.</p>

<p class="pp6 p1">In that Parthenopean Company<br />
I sang the Threnody for several dead,<br />

The noble surgeon and philanthropist;<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a><br />

And in the presence of the royal court,<br />

He mine inspirer from the living stone<br />

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>Came to embrace me ’mid a crushing throng;<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a><br />
And with my daring images I struck<br />
French, Russians, Germans, Spaniards, Englishmen.</p>

<p class="pp6 p1">And now in Sapphic now in Theban mood,<br />
I sang beside the urn, with laurel wreathed,<br />
Wherein Luigi Quattromani sleeps,<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a><br />
A casket from the Bible’s treasure-stores:<br />
In him I greeted, and I bless him now,<br />
The kindly master in the social friend.<br />
Truly a poet&mdash;I seem to see him still&mdash;<br />
Inspired himself, inspiring others too:<br />
When blind and old, he in his mind preserved<br />
Acutest sight and lively youthfulness.</p>

<p class="p1">I interrupt the verse-narrative for a moment, to point
out that Rossetti here recounts&mdash;what was of leading
importance in his Neapolitan career&mdash;how he came to
be an improvising poet. Luigi Quattromani was a renowned
improvisatore, and (so far as I infer) little or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
not at all an author of verse written and published.
The date when Rossetti first knew him, and soon
afterwards began improvising, is not here defined; I
suppose it may have been towards 1810. When my
father came to London in 1824 he resolved not to
prolong the practice; thinking, and no doubt rightly,
that, although he might excite some surprise and attention
by improvising, it would on the whole lower his
position as a serious professional man in the teaching
and literary vocation. Yet he did occasionally give a
specimen of his prowess as an extempore poet; the
latest notice I find of such a performance was in his
family-circle, in 1840. If I myself ever heard him improvise,
I have forgotten it. The observations which
he here makes on the dangers of the habit, both to
health and to purity of poetic style, are worth noting.
He first proceeds with a description of Quattromani’s
doings.</p>

<p class="pp6 p1">Whenso I heard him touch on David’s harp,<br />
All fervid with extemporaneous power,<br />
Upon his face shone out the impassioned soul<br />
Which spread around spontaneous bursts of light.<br />
And that same flame I saw a-shine in him<br />
On mine own spirit did I feel descend.<br />
Yes, what I heard meseemed not possible;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>’Twas ecstasy to me, enchantment, dream.<br />
But what appeared incredible almost<br />
Was coming to be realized in myself.<br />
On my way home I tried to do the like,<br />
And oh astonishment! I also sang<br />
Line after line: so strange the upshot seemed<br />
That I renewed the essay for several days.<br />
By daytime and by night assiduously<br />
Did I repeat that same experiment.<br />
Often with Quattromani I conferred,<br />
Who gave my verses not a little praise;<br />
And once the blind old man exclaimed to me&mdash;<br />
“Alternate with me in an improvise.”<br />
And, after a few trials and demands,<br />
He took me up with so much ardent zest<br />
That ’mid the pomp of images produced<br />
He gave me many a “viva” from his heart.<br />
He closed by saying: “For poetic strifes<br />
Nature has given you athletic power.”<br />
“Persist,” he often said to me, “persist,<br />
And let no sloth impede you on your road.<br />
A poet you were born, and those who seek<br />
To change your course&mdash;believe this&mdash;envy you.<br />
What you at your commencement do with me<br />
Might seem the fruit of lengthy studying.”<br />
And often did our verses alternate<br />
In choice assemblies with co-equal praise,<br />
So much men’s judgments wavered in the scales<br />
That ’twixt us victory remained in doubt.<br />
But this impressed on me the stamp of worth&mdash;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>What honour to contend with such a man!<br />
He, like a living mirror, faces me,<br />
And, seeing myself in him, I can but grieve.<br />
He old and blind, and I too blind and old:<br />
And he died poor, and I am dying poor.<br />
But which of us the more deplorable?<br />
He in his country, I exiled by fate!</p>

<p class="pp6 p1">Oft on this foreign shore I’ve asked myself,<br />
Did my addiction to extempore song<br />
Harm me, or profit? I remain in doubt.<br />
But this, without nice solving, I’ll affirm&mdash;<br />
I was becoming palsied and in spasms.<br />
A Galen’s rigour ought to cry it down,<br />
And thus prevent so miserable an end.<br />
’Twas so my Brother Dominick expired,<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a><br />
Who in such efforts was expert and apt.<br />
I never heard that brother of mine recite&mdash;<br />
He left me a child, but I remember him;<br />
And well I know that he at Parma’s bar<br />
Was greeted as a re-born Cicero.<br />
Youthful he died, far from his family&mdash;<br />
And wherefore died? Because he improvised.<br />
More than one symptom has convinced me clear<br />
That, through my leaving off that exercise,<br />
Exile, in that alone, has been my friend:<br />
And so, from much reflection I can say,<br />
That mental strain leads to paralysis.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>Nor only with regard to healthful life<br />
Makes it the nerves uncertain and unstrung,<br />
But as to writing with correctness too<br />
I fear at last it worsens toward neglect.<br />
Yes, that it harms the style I can but think:<br />
To work a-sudden is not working well.<br />
Thou who wouldst merit the Phœbean wreath,<br />
O youth, take caution ’gainst this same abuse;<br />
For these my verses, written slipshod-like,<br />
Perhaps derive from that ill-wont of mine;<br />
For now I hurry verse to follow verse,<br />
And reel them off as ’twere a kind of talk.<br />
Good composition craves a needful space,<br />
Not emulous capricious fantasy.</p>

<p class="pp6 p2">Though such a practice I cannot defend,<br />
Still I become renowned because of that.<br />
Full many a noted passage from my muse<br />
Was quoted, serious and facetious both;<br />

For me has vanished all: only the grave<br />
Awaits me, and thither willingly I go.<br />
Life is a lengthened dream, and, when it ends,<br />
All lettered glory is a dream as well;<br />
And vanity of vanities I mark,<br />
Yea even in that which crowns the highest of men<br />

Classic in style, and resonant and terse;<br />
Lastly, the third one had to be pronounced<br />

<p class="p1">I must here make a little digression, to illustrate
this matter of “Tyrtæus.” It need scarcely be said
that Tyrtæus, who flourished about 650 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, was a
Greek elegiac poet, born in Attica, lame and misshapen,
and totally ignorant of military matters. In
the second Messenian war the Lacedæmonians were
directed by the oracle to apply to the Athenians for
a general; and the Athenians (such at least is the
legend, which may be largely discounted without undue
scepticism) sent them Tyrtæus. This looked very like
a <i>mauvaise plaisanterie</i>, and was so regarded by the
Lacedæmonians; yet the result justified the oracle, and
the Athenians as well. The poet poured forth his
strains with such splendid impulse and vigour that
he animated the troops; they abandoned the idea of
raising the siege of Ithome, and thoroughly defeated
the Messenians. “The popularity of these elegies in
the Spartan army was such that it became the custom
to sing them round the camp-fires at night, the polemarch
rewarding the best singer with a piece of
flesh.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>The term “Tyrtæus of Italy” (Tirteo d’Italia) has
been constantly applied by his countrymen to Gabriele
Rossetti. I am not clear when this practice began,
whether before or only after 1846, when Rossetti, in
his <i>Veggente in Solitudine</i>, applied the term to <i>himself</i>.
At any rate, I had until recently assumed that the
phrase had only a lax application, as indicating that
Rossetti, by his declaimed and published patriotic
lyrics, had incited, and would continue to incite,
Italians to combat for liberty and independence. But
of late I have come to the almost confident conclusion
that he must have taken a personal part in the sole
military expedition in which the Neapolitan army
sought to maintain the constitution of 1820. This
conclusion is founded upon a letter (in my possession)
which a certain Dr Costanza&mdash;to me not otherwise
known&mdash;addressed to my father on 10th November
1847. I first read the letter with attention towards
1896, and I here give a translation of it.</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p class="pr4 p1">“<span class="smcap">Gibraltar.</span></p>
<p class="pr2">“<i>10th November 1847.</i></p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Honoured Compatriot</span>,</p>

<p class="pi12">“Twenty-six years have now
passed since we bade one another a last adieu in the Island
of Malta, at the fatal period of ’21. You must recollect
Dr Costanza, then a young physician and surgeon, now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
turned of fifty years of age. You had known him in the
capital of the kingdom, and you afterwards met him at
Montecassino, <i>when you were returning from the gorges of
Antrodoca after the hapless result of that first passage of arms</i>
upon which depended the fate of our country. That Costanza
is now writing to you, and warmly recommends to you three
fellow-countrymen of ours, recently saved by miracle from
the blood-red hands of the agents of the tyrant of Naples
and Sicily....</p>

<p class="pr4">“Your Compatriot, and erewhile Companion</p>
<p class="pr8">in misfortune,</p>
<p class="pr2"><span class="smcap">Dr Costanza</span>.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">In this letter the mention of Antrodoca (or Antrodoco)
is the essential thing. The mountains of
Antrodoco are near Rieti, which was the scene of an
engagement, on 7th March 1821, between the Neapolitan
and the Austrian troops. The actual feat
of arms was not discreditable to the Italians; but&mdash;perceiving
that they were the weaker party, and that
the final issue was hopeless for them&mdash;they immediately
afterwards disbanded, and all was over. I cannot
indeed, recollect having ever heard from my father
that he was along with the army on that occasion,
nor does he affirm it in his versified Autobiography;
yet I now see that he must have been so. I do not
infer that he was in the fighting ranks; but I do
infer that two passages which are to be found in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
<i>Veggente in Solitudine</i> have a more positive meaning
than I used to attribute to them. The passages are
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">1. “Fratelli, all’armi, all’armi!” etc.</p>

<p>“Brothers, to arms, to arms! Our country has summoned
us. <i>I, with my stimulating songs, will also go among you.</i>”</p>

<p>2. (As already referred to) “Tirteo d’Italia,” etc.</p>

<p>“Who will be the Tyrtæus of Italy in the camp? ’Tis I,
’tis I! <i>Such I have been</i>, such I am.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">The first of these passages comes from a song
composed by Rossetti towards the date of the soldiering
in 1821. The second may have been written about
1845.</p>

<p>I have found one other paper which seems to bear
upon this semi-military act of Gabriele Rossetti. An
excellent friend of his, Ferdinando Ciciloni, wrote to
him from Naples on 24th November 1825, saying:
“Three days ago I went to San Sebastiano, which,
from the seat of the Parliament, has become a College
of Music. As I crossed the courtyard, I had a mental
vision of Rossetti in uniform, and with two very
black moustaches.” As we have seen (note on p. 36),
Rossetti, though not at all a man of a soldiering turn, had
belonged, in 1814, to the Guard of Internal Security
under King Joachim, and once again, in 1821, he donned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
a uniform&mdash;a British one this time. But Ciciloni’s
remark does not seem very likely to refer to either
of these incidents; rather to something in which the
Parliament-building was concerned, and a muster
immediately before the departure of the army to Rieti
appears the most probable occurrence.</p>

Didst spread afar thy nautical command,<br />
Thee sinuous the Mediterranean,<br />
And thee vast Ocean’s sheer immensity,<br />
Saw dominating the unstable wave,<br />
And christened thee the Formidable Fort.<br />
Thee from the skiff I see, and feed my glance,<br />
As on artilleried walls, upon thy bows.</p>

<p class="pp6 p1">The mighty ship gave symptoms of good-will,<br />
Expressed in divers modes by the ample crew;<br />
And I&mdash;I kissed that wooden Albion<br />
Amid the naval group who smiled thereat.<br />
To the saloon bright-shining in the dusk<br />
I sped, to give Thetis and Neptune thanks.<br />
“Here is a pair of gods not fabulous,”<br />
I said, when greeted by their noble smiles.<br />
The grace which can forestall a modest wish<br />
I always found on either countenance.</p>

<p class="pp6 p1">Then in the night I went with saddened soul<br />
To contemplate the shore which met my view.<br />
All are reposing in the silent hour,<br />

Stand communing with this my land betrayed;<br />
And a few happy days and many dire<br />
Are passing in review before mine eyes.<br />
Ever ferocious Tyranny I saw<br />
Becoming stronger by flagitious means;<br />
And Freedom, tasted for a few poor days,<br />
Begetting, like the fruit of Eden, death;<br />
And Treason, like a snake pestiferous,<br />
From two great goblets sipping tears and blood.<br />
And, while my fantasy on every side<br />
Ran riot, struck by miserable ideas,<br />
The scenes of sanguinary Ninety-nine<br />
Offered themselves to my dejected soul;<br />

A host funereal of threat’ning ghosts.<br />

<h3 class="p4" id="c060">LIFE IN EXILE&mdash;MALTA AND ENGLAND</h3>


<p class="pp6 p2">To thee the first the British prow was turned,<br />
Flourishing Malta, small but beautiful,<br />
A quiet refuge ’mid the unquiet sea,<br />
Of an Italian mind and Arab speech.<br />
I, sifting out of fallacies the truth,<br />
Full half a lustre passed within thy bounds;<br />
And, but for patriotic sorrowings,<br />
Out there I should have led a placid life,&mdash;<br />
For I encountered courteous, cultured minds,&mdash;<br />
Culture in some, in many courtesy.</p>

<p class="pp6 p1">But both of these&mdash;they have my homage here&mdash;<br />
I amply in one person found conjoined,<br />
John Hookham Frere, a learned man and wise,<br />
A Privy Councillor of the British Crown.<br />
Himself he shone, not through extraneous aids,<br />
And how I knew him I shall gladly tell.<br />
Fame, so propitious to poetic gifts,<br />
In Malta made a magnified report&mdash;<br />
That Italy’s Tyrtæus had arrived,<br />
And rescued by the British Admiral.<br />
And I by many people was informed<br />
That in the higher class the wish prevailed<br />
That in some noted house I should display<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>My fervour of poetic improvise;<br />
And I, now so suspicious of my powers,<br />
Unhesitating answered&mdash;“Yes, at once.”</p>

<p class="pp6 p1">Ah me unhappy! I’m no more the man!<br />
But such must be the course of human fate.<br />
Too true, I, then a river, am now a rill&mdash;<br />
A rill which comes anear to drying up.<br />
In vain I stir my fancy, which is tired,&mdash;<br />
I cannot even command poetic phrase.<br />
These verses&mdash;let me say this prose in rhyme&mdash;<br />
As I dictate them, others write them down,<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a><br />
And, as they all gush out extempore,<br />
Some of them will be good, and others bad:<br />
Nor do I blot the bad to keep the best,<br />
But pass them current as they chance to come.<br />
To get the whole expressed without constraint,<br />
And without labouring after phrase and word,<br />
I pitched on purpose on that sextal rhyme<br />
In which one easily words the thing one wants.</p>

<p class="pp6 p1">On my assent, a spacious hall prepares<br />
For ladies, men of letters, diplomats.<br />
There that distinguished man enraptured heard<br />
My burst of song ’mid plaudits many and full;<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a><br />
And, being unused to such demonstrances,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>He deemed the thing almost a prodigy.<br />
I sang six themes, and my excited mind<br />
Poured copiously divergent styles and rhythms.<br />
Persons of eminence, the following day,<br />
Graced me by visits of civility.<br />
But one beneficent and reverend mien<br />
In which I read exalted characters,<br />
A diction which, arising from the soul,<br />
Goes to the heart, and fixes what it says&mdash;<br />
This ’mid the throng I noted. He being gone,<br />
I asked his name&mdash;and it astonished me;<br />
For all that I had heard rumoured around<br />
About his talents settled on my thought:<br />
An ample treasure-house of classic lore,<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a><br />
Such did Fame publish him by hundred mouths:<br />
Toward him desire resistless drew me on,<br />
Nor did his presence lessen his repute.<br />
Unconscious of his fame he singly seemed,&mdash;<br />
To hear it named was what he could not brook;<br />
Courtesy generous and without display,<br />
Learning immense, and greater modesty;&mdash;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>Ah who could paint that noble-natured man?<br />
One day when he accorded praise anew<br />
To chaunts of mine which wakened his surprise,<br />
I answered him: “In you I seem to see<br />
The imperial eagle by a sparrow charmed.<br />
I know my verse has earned me banishment;<br />
But I, excelling some, bend low to you.”<br />
And later, when I saw how plenteously<br />
He dealt his succours to the sick and poor,<br />
I in John Hookham Frere discerned the type<br />
Of the sublime Christian philosopher.<br />
None but an angel could pourtray him true,&mdash;<br />
I feel my eyes grow moist to speak of him.<br />
He called me friend, and that has been my pride,<br />
And in myself I reverenced the name.<br />
Having that store of virtues in my gaze,<br />
Sanctified in him by Christianity,&mdash;<br />
’Tis sacred duty to confess as much&mdash;<br />
I felt myself grow better by so great<br />
A pattern. Nevermore he left my thoughts,<br />
And even in death within my heart he lives.</p>

<p class="pp6 p1">To him, after I reached the English shores<br />
(All distant from him though I then had passed),<br />
I dedicated Dante’s Comedy,<br />
With Analytic Comment from my pen.<br />
That Psaltery to him too I inscribed<br />
Which praises freedom and ennobles man,<br />
And he with kindliness received the wish<br />
I showed that it be dedicate to him.<br />
Of him with lively gratitude anew<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>I chaunted in my “Seer in Solitude.”<br />
Those lines while I was writing, thou, blest soul,<br />
Wast winging forth thy way to Paradise,<br />
There to embrace the sister and the spouse<br />
From whom thou languishing wast parted here.</p>

<p class="pp6 p1">O all of you elected spirits and pure,<br />
Look down on desolate Rossetti’s grief.<br />
He in himself holds that same constancy<br />
Which every one of you applauded oft.<br />
Still exiled, but now old, infirm, and blind,<br />
How different alas from other-while!<br />
Different? Ah no! Although oppressed by years,<br />
He for his country always is the same.<br />
And he, on hearing how that freedom’s tree<br />
Has there re-budded, full of sapfulness,<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a><br />
Blesses his every sweat of brow poured out<br />
To irrigate its high ancestral germ;<br />
And, now when all men sweat to nurture it<br />
He hopes before he dies to taste its fruits.<br />
Now Scythian cold, ’tis true, reigns everywhere,<br />
But none can think it will last on for aye:<br />
To the political winter now endured<br />
A more propitious season must succeed;<br />
And all by various signs can estimate<br />
That flowers and fruits we yet shall see in bloom.</p>

<p class="p1">As Rossetti has here mentioned his edition of Dante’s
<i>Comedy</i>, and his own <i>Psaltery</i>, and as references occur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
later on to other publications of his, I may as well
enter at once into some details in elucidation. After
his arrival in England he printed the following works:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. 1826-7. Dante’s <i>Inferno</i>, with a “Comento
Analitico.” The intention was to publish the whole
of the <i>Divina Commedia</i>: but, the expense proving
too great, the <i>Inferno</i> alone came out. The great
majority of the comment on the <i>Purgatorio</i> was written&mdash;not
any (I think) of that on the <i>Paradiso</i>. The MS.
comment on the <i>Purgatorio</i> was presented by me in
1883 to the Municipality of Vasto, under a stipulation
(volunteered by the Municipality itself) that they
would print it; but this has not been done, and
indeed the MS. volume was treated in a highly
neglectful style. My father, when in Italy, was of
course very well acquainted with Dante’s poem;
but he had not studied it with any keenness of
scrutiny until he settled in London. When he did
that, he soon reached the conclusion that the surface
of Dante’s <i>Commedia</i> is very different from its inner
core of meaning. At first he considered the inner core
to be political: the Empire and Ghibellinism, as against
the Papacy and Guelfism. As he progressed his conceptions
expanded, and he regarded Dante as a member,
both in politics and in religion, of an occult society<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
having a close relation to what we now call Freemasonry;
and he opined that the <i>Commedia</i> and other
writings of Dante, and also the books of many other
famous authors in various languages and epochs, are
of similar internal significance. It is not my purpose
here to discuss whether he was right or wrong: I hold
that he was highly ingenious, that some of his reasonings
deserve very careful attention, and that in several
instances he pushed things too far. His comment on
Dante, and subsequent writings in the same direction,
excited some notice in Italy, and at least as much in
England. Coleridge thought well of his speculations
up to, but not beyond, a certain point; Isaac Disraeli
was fully convinced by them; Arthur Hallam, and
afterwards Panizzi and Schlegel, wrote in opposition.
A learned German, Joseph Mendelssohn, lectured in
Berlin on Rossetti’s system, and published his discourses,
which are more expository than critical, in
1843. A remarkable book (later than my No. 2)
was brought out at Naples by Vecchioni, embodying
a course of interpretation and argument closely resembling
that of Rossetti, who never quite understood
whether the conclusions of Vecchioni had been formed
independently or not.</p>

<p>2. 1832. <i>Lo Spirito Antipapale che produsse la Riforma</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
(The Anti-papal Spirit which produced the
Reformation) develops and extends the ideas, which
Rossetti had conceived during his study of Dante, as
to a secret society to which that poet and many other
writers belonged, and as to the essentially anti-Christian
as well as anti-papal opinions covertly expressed in
their writings. An English translation of this work
was published.</p>

<p>3. 1833. The work to which the Autobiography has
applied the name <i>Psaltery</i> is entitled <i>Iddio e l’Uomo,
Salterio</i> (God and Man, a Psaltery). The majority of
it was written in Malta: in London considerable
additions and changes were made. Leaving some of his
individual lyrics out of account, this may be regarded
as the completest and best poetic work produced by
Rossetti. In 1843 it was republished under a new title,
<i>Il Tempo</i> (Time), and with some substantial modifications
of plan. This book, and our No. 2, are down
in the Pontifical <i>Index Librorum Prohibitorum</i>.</p>

<p>4. 1840. <i>Il Mistero dell’ Amor Platonico del Medio
Evo derivato dai Misteri Antichi</i> (The Mystery of the
Platonic Love of the Middle Ages derived from the
Ancient Mysteries). This extensive and rather discursive
work, in five volumes, follows up the line of
speculation and argument shown in Nos. 1 and 2.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
Rossetti wrote it with a consciousness that the themes
of religion or irreligion which it discusses were volcanic
matter for readers to handle, as well as perilous to his
own professional position in England. He therefore
exhibited his subject with some amount of reticence,
meandering through thickets of very audacious thought&mdash;the
thought of great writers of the past as interpreted
(but also to a great extent deprecated) by himself.
This book was printed; but, as Mr Frere, partially
seconded by Mr Charles Lyell, pronounced it to be
foolhardy, it was withheld from publication in England,
and was only put on sale on the Continent with precaution
and in small numbers.</p>

<p>5. 1842. <i>La Beatrice di Dante</i>&mdash;an argument that
Dante’s Beatrice was not in any sense a real woman, but
an embodiment of Philosophy. The reasoning extends
a good deal beyond this limit, into regions explored in
Nos. 1, 2, and 4. Rossetti completed the work in three
disquisitions&mdash;or indeed, according to the final arrangement,
in nine disquisitions. Only the first of these
was published. The others were entrusted to a
French writer, M. E. Aroux. He studied them, and
published a book named <i>Dante Hérétique, Révolutionnaire,
et Socialiste</i>&mdash;a book which my father, on
seeing it in print, did not acknowledge as by any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
means faithful to his own views. The MS. was returned
to Rossetti: somehow it could never be found
in our household until the close of 1900, when I
discovered it, more or less complete, in an old portfolio.</p>

<p>6. 1846. <i>Il Veggente in Solitudine</i> (The Seer in
Solitude) is a long poem of patriotic aim, in several books
and all sorts of metres. Its main object is to denounce
the then political and religious condition of Italy, and
to forecast a better future. This is mixed up with
a good deal of autobiographical matter, and with many
lyrics of old time (some of them evincing Rossetti’s
very best work) interpolated into the context. As a
rounded achievement of poetry, this book cannot be
eulogized; it had, however, a great though clandestine
circulation in Italy, roused enthusiastic feelings, and
was so much prized that an honorary medallion of
Rossetti, the work of Signor Cerbara, was struck.</p>

<p>7. 1847. <i>Versi</i>, published at Lausanne. This volume
has not a directly patriotic or political complexion:
it consists of many of Rossetti’s best poems of early
date, along with some of recent years.</p>

<p>8. 1852. <i>L’Arpa Evangelica</i> (The Evangelic Harp).
Although printed in 1852, this volume only reached
Rossetti’s hands at an advanced date in 1853. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
consists of hymns and lyrics of a distinctly Christian,
combined with an enlarged humanitarian, character.
Several of the poems in this volume are now used
in the Evangelical churches of Italy. I find twenty-one
in a volume entitled <i>Inni e Cantici ad uso delle
Chiese, Famiglie, Scuole, ed Associazioni Cristiane
d’ Italia</i>. Roma, 1897.</p>

<p>It may be as well to say here something as to my
father’s religious opinions. His parents were religious
Catholics of the ordinary Italian type. His bringing-up
was religious; and I suppose that, until manhood
was well advanced, he acquiesced, without special zeal,
in the established views and practices of Catholicism.
As his political opinions progressed into active opposition
to despotism and the foreign yoke, so did his
religious opinions progress into active, and indeed very
fierce, opposition to Papal dogma and pretensions,
and to all that side of Roman Catholicism which
pertains more to sacerdotal and hierarchical system
than to the personality and the gospel utterances of
Jesus Christ. On the other hand, he never ceased to
cherish and reverence this original basis of Evangelical
faith and practice. As I knew him from my earliest
years (say from 1834), he adhered to no ecclesiastical
sect whatever; and&mdash;allowing for the primitive-Christian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
sympathy just referred to&mdash;he was certainly far more
a free-thinker than definitely a Christian. As his
writings were never of a personally anti-Christian
tone (though they often developed the anti-Christian
views of other authors), and <i>were</i> of an anti-papal
tone, he became mixed up in his later years with
Italian anti-papal Protestantizing religionists, to an
extent greater than in his prime he would have
tolerated. Towards 1849 disfrocked priests and semi-Waldensian
semi-simpletons got a good deal about
him, when broken health and precarious eyesight had
to some extent enfeebled his mental along with his
bodily powers; and association with these people and
their publications did certainly not tend to promote
a vigorous presentment of his essentially undogmatic
but not essentially unspiritual mind. He came to
write about Christian matters in terms suited to
an absolute Christian believer; whereas, in fact, he
was a devotional adherent to the moral and spiritual
utterances of Jesus, but was not a practising member
of any Christian denomination, nor a disciple in any
theological school. It should be understood that,
though a fervent and outspoken anti-papalist, he never
expressly renounced the Roman Catholic faith. In
the earlier years of his London sojourn it might have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
been to his advantage (as Professor of Italian in King’s
College and elsewhere) to join the Anglican rather
than the Roman communion; but this he considered
unworthy of an Italian, and he never took any
step in that direction. Neither did he naturalize
himself as an Englishman.</p>

<p>The means of Gabriele Rossetti were never equal
to paying the cost of expensive publications. My
No. 1 was brought out by subscription; Nos. 2 and 4
by the spontaneous liberality of Mr Lyell, and, as far
as No. 4 is concerned, Mr Frere came forward, as well,
at the close. It is only fair to say that Rossetti was
a laborious worker, of independent spirit; and, though
he accepted with grateful satisfaction the volunteered
bounty of Mr Lyell in these instances, and of Mr
Frere in some others likewise, he was the least likely
of men to go about to “ask, and ye shall receive.”</p>

<p>As I have been speaking&mdash;with the distaste which
I learned to feel for them as a class&mdash;of Protestantizing
Italians, I will add that one excellent man I
have known among them was my cousin Teodorico
Pietrocola-Rossetti. He was in London in the later
years of my father’s life, but was not then taking an
active part in the Evangelical propaganda to which
he devoted all the closing part of his career. In 1883<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
he died in Florence, while conducting a service for
his congregation. A great number of his hymns are
in the collection <i>Inni e Cantici</i> before mentioned.</p>

<p class="pp6 p1">Back to my tale. And I should here premise<br />
That, turning lengthened studies to account,<br />
I undertook in Malta first to spread<br />
A taste for our Italian literature;<br />
And in distinguished houses not a few<br />
To witness others’ progress was my joy.<br />
A Massic or Falernian wine no more<br />
I drank, as oft in Naples I had done,<br />
But quaffed the spirit of the classics now<br />
Alone, and none could say “Why gorge thyself?”<br />
But, even in study laudable howe’er,<br />
Intemperance is still condemnable.<br />
Many, I know, find teaching wearisome,<br />
Whereas to me ’twas profit and repute;<br />
And I could all repeat from memory<br />
The Comedy of Dante, mystical,<br />
Tasso, Ariosto, drama, satirists,<br />
Petrarch, Chiabrera, and some lyrists more.<br />
Become the foremost of professors there,<br />
I knew the most distinguished travellers<br />
And highest officers of government:<br />
Indeed, from titled man to boatman, all<br />
Bore me affection&mdash;saving only one.</p>

<p class="pp6 p1">The Consul there from Naples was Gerardi,<br />
Who constantly molested refugees.<br />
One day that upon me he fixed his glance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span><br />
I cried: “You hangman’s face, what see you in me?”<br />
Confused he drooped his far from pleasant eyes,<br />
And put the tail of him between his legs.<br />
This serf of tyrant power endeavoured then<br />
To get me turned adrift out of the isle,<br />
When Albion’s Sejanus, Castlereagh,<br />
Was ordering to expel the fugitives:<br />
But this Gerardi (he might cry with rage)<br />
Had read my face “Noli me tangere.”<br />
As long as there I lived, I felt assured<br />
That all the world contained no baser man;<br />
But, when I saw in London a Minasi,<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a><br />
I found that I had made a great mistake.<br />
But such a name, by God, pollutes my lips.<br />
No, let my mouth be nevermore befouled<br />
To speak a most opprobrious brigand’s name!<br />
Go, galleys’ rot, or rather gallows’ rot,<br />
Go, Ruffo’s bravo<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> and worse knave than he!</p>

<p class="pp6 p1">Through that Gerardi, under-strapper of Kings,<br />

And a Poerio,<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> in his rage convulsed,<br />
Was first imprisoned, afterwards expelled.<br />
And Pier de Luca (I record with tears<br />
Thy fate, the flower of courteous learned men)<br />
And Pier de Luca lost his reason hence,<br />
And was in frenzy for some days and nights:<br />
He trembled at Gerardi’s very name,<br />
And later on, to escape, he drowned himself.<br />
O Castlereagh! Thy country rightly deems<br />
That thy best service was thy suicide;<br />
But why no suicide a year before?</p>

<p class="pp6 p1">Indignant I returned to England’s masts,<br />

A nest of corsairs Malta now meseemed,<br />

<p class="pp6 p1">The curst Gerardi, in insulting terms,<br />
Had written to the Bourbon Council-board<br />
How that Rossetti, that incendiary,<br />

And cried the King: “Upon a sovereign’s faith,<br />
I’ll do my utmost to get hold of him.”<br />
Well had that General Fardella said,<br />
Who gave me secret pledge of friendliness,<br />
That a malignant star detained me there,<br />
Since o’er me impended a tremendous ire.<br />
And I had stayed, at hazard of my life,<br />
For full three months exposed to all the risk!<br />
Following routine, the British Admiral<br />
Was bidding farewell to the Sovereign;<br />
And he perceived astonished that for rage<br />
The King, like a hyæna, bit his lips.<br />
Treating him almost as a menial, he<br />
Said with an angry and imperious tone:<br />
“Surrender that rebellious subject whom<br />
You saved, and now to England would conduct.”<br />
And he with firmset aspect made reply:<br />
“An English Admiral will not be base.”<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>Menaces and entreaties he contemned,<br />
And turned his back on him resolvedly;<br />
And, when that evening he returned aboard,<br />
He told what was demanded and refused.<br />
And such a fact cannot be called in doubt,<br />
For all o’er Naples did its rumour run.</p>

<p class="pp6 p1">I felt myself so moved by that account<br />
That, in the presence of his noble wife,<br />

Thee may God guerdon, mounted soul in heaven!<br />
Twice over did I owe my life to thee,&mdash;<br />
And gracious lady, God bless thee alike!</p>

<p class="pp6 p1">And I reflected: “Why in Ferdinand<br />
Boils up against me such a fierce despite<br />
That, not appeased by lifelong banishment,<br />
He would inflict on me a barbarous death?<br />
So much of rage against my civic song,<br />
In which as father I so lauded him!<br />
And how has he forgotten those my lines<br />
Which drew the very tear-drops from his eyes?”</p>

<p class="pp6 p1">The savage spirit! When he heard me named,<br />
His knees would jog beneath his body’s weight,<br />
And he against me, the poor exiled bard,<br />
Was all a-tremble, furiously convulsed.<br />
And thence a truthful penman wrote to me<br />
He had himself from the fierce Bourbon heard&mdash;<br />
“If even the court declares him innocent,<br />
I’ll make him die under the bastinade:<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>On public scaffold or in darkest crypt<br />
Die he infallibly shall&mdash;and that I swear.”<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a><br />
Thus for a long while I remained in doubt<br />
Of the true motive for such senseless rage:<br />
But then the pen of a most worthy man<br />
Gave me a light amid the obscurity.<br />
What time the King of Naples had decamped,<br />
And I had turned my course to another goal,<br />
Some praise of me was heard by Gaspare Mollo<br />
Duke of Lusciano, who was reckoned then<br />
An able poet; and my fate so willed<br />
That he desired to meet me face to face.<br />
Of voluntary good-will he gave me proofs,<br />
Which I responded to with modesty:<br />
But, when he heard me improvise in verse,<br />
Mollo became as jealous as a beast:<br />
He in my presence spoke in jest alone,<br />
But poured his insults forth behind my back.<br />
He piqued himself the most on improvise:<br />
He saw his primacy endangered much,<br />
And tried his best to make me ludicrous.<br />
And I upon his dramas and his rhymes<br />
(For who can damp a youthful poet’s fire?)<br />
Launched a good ten or dozen epigrams,<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>Which many men rehearsed with loud guffaws.<br />
For one he gave me, I returned him ten:<br />
This was ill done, I know&mdash;but so I did.<br />
Mollo kept brooding o’er his inward grudge,<br />
Which well I read upon his pallid cheek.<br />
Now, when the liberal Government had fall’n,<br />
He was installed as President of a Board<br />
To overhaul the writings then produced.<br />
The President, and Censors in his wake,<br />
From that explosion of anonymous print<br />
Chose hundreds of inflammatory attacks,<br />
And called them all my own&mdash;no fable this&mdash;<br />
And showed me like a devil to the King.<br />
And how that monumental lie disprove?<br />
If even I had been Briareus,<br />
Writing by night and day with hundred pens,<br />
It would have been a thing impossible<br />
To achieve that quantity of verse and prose.<br />
A shameless slander! Yet my enemy<br />
Mouths it against me, and the King believes.</p>

<p class="p1">This statement about the Duke of Lusciano may be
quite true&mdash;a point as to which I am not competent
to express an opinion. I have always understood,
however, that one main professed grievance of the
King against Rossetti was as follows (and in candour
I state it here, as I did in my Memoir of Dante
Rossetti):&mdash;At the time when an Austrian invasion
of the Neapolitan territory, connived at by King
Ferdinand, was imminent, Rossetti wrote a lyric expressive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
of the patriotic rage natural at the time, containing
this quatrain addressed to the King&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“I vindici coltelli</p>
<p class="pp7">Sapran passarvi il cor:</p>
<p class="pp6">I Sandi ed i Luvelli</p>
<p class="pp7">Non son finiti ancor.”</p>

<p class="pn1">(Avenging knives will be apt to pierce<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> your heart:
the Sands and the Louvels are not yet done with).
These lines clearly say that King Ferdinand, if he
were to persist in a certain course, would be very
liable to be assassinated; and, although they do not
add that he <i>ought</i> to be assassinated, the Rè Nasone
cannot have been solitary in scenting out that implication.
There was also the affair (referred to on
p. 50 as more than probable) that Rossetti had accompanied
the Neapolitan troops, animating them by his
verses to fight against the Austrians in defence of a
constitution which the King, by a gross act of perjury,
had then abolished.</p>

<p class="pp6 p1">We in the harbour of Naples made a stay<br />

Love proffered me its frenzies and remorse:<br />
But, never a seducer, still seduced,<br />
Quicksand to quicksand, angry seas I ploughed:<br />

A dreadful shudder creeps along my veins,<br />
And in that shudder I my visage smite,<br />
Uttering a curse against my weaknesses.<br />
The quicksands are afar, the harbour’s here.</p>

<p class="pp6 p1">Settled in London, all my travels past,<br />
Among the men I most was pleased to meet,<br />
Gaetano Polidori, learned, wise,<br />
Who had been Count Alfieri’s secretary,<br />
’Mid all the Italians whom I had known as yet<br />
Appeared to merit honour and esteem.<br />
Teaching was his profession. He had done<br />
No small translating-work, had much composed.<br />
Tuscan by birth, by accent all the more,<br />
An elegant writer both in prose and verse,<br />
He showed me, joined with candid character,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>The strictest morals and a cultured mind.<br />
Upon the day when I returned his call,<br />
And saw him ’mid his well-bred family,<br />
I twice and thrice fixed my admiring eyes<br />
Upon the second daughter’s comeliness.<br />
A single moment regulates a life:<br />
My heart became the lodestone, she the pole.<br />
And every hour my love became more keen<br />
When hundred virtues and no self-conceit ...<br />
I know that what I’m writing she dislikes,<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a><br />
But, hiding it from her, I speak it still:<br />
Knowing her fully, I have often said&mdash;<br />
Angel in soul, and angel in her looks.<br />
Feeling within me glow the lighted flame,<br />
I wrote to Polidori, and ’twas thus:<br />
“If to the gracious name of friend you please<br />
To add the loving name of son as well<br />
(Pray Heaven that so it may be!) be not loth<br />
To give the enclosed into your Frances’ hands.<br />
If this displease you, little though it were,<br />
If so it haps you disapprove my suit,<br />
Throw the two letters both into the fire,<br />
And speak of this no more; but pray concede<br />
Our friendship be not sundered, yours and mine,&mdash;<br />
You so would punish my straightforwardness.”<br />
A day being past, the maid to me so dear<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>Gave me a most affectionate response;<br />
And at the altar after four months more<br />
We vowed between us two a mutual faith.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a><br />
In marriage-knot at summit of my hopes,<br />
My days went by in cheerful industry.<br />
As sweet reward of honourable zeal,<br />
My credit made advance from day to day.<br />
Four only children Heaven conceded me,<br />
And all the four I see around me still,<br />
The issue of affections tender and true<br />
In the four opening matrimonial years.</p>

<p class="pp6 p1">To speak about my wife I shall not pause,&mdash;<br />
Others would think it overcharged, inept:<br />
This I may tell&mdash;she is a blooming graft<br />
Of English mother and of Tuscan sire;<br />
Through mother and through sire in her one sees<br />
Two nations tempering the mind and heart.<br />
Let me but say that in her is evinced<br />
Frankness of manner unpremeditate;<br />
That she both speaks and writes three high-prized tongues,<br />
Which rank ’mong Europe’s choicest and most rich;<br />
And, when their authors she was studying,<br />
She culled the flower of the three literatures.<br />

For of each rule she utters with her lips<br />

I never had occasion for a school,<br />

(Presenting now this model and now that)<br />
The taste for letters and the beautiful.<br />
In theory and in practice, both alike,<br />
Her life is a fine treatise on the good:<br />
Always a Christian, not a fanatic,<br />
Always devout, but not ecstatical:<br />
Heavens, what a woman! her Anglo-Italian soul<br />
Has never trespassed over duty’s bound.<br />
’Tis now five lustres I have made her mine,<br />
And in five lustres I still see her the more<br />
An angel harmony of deeds and words,<br />
And in five lustres her all-blameless life<br />
Has not one moment, one, belied itself.<br />
I thank my God that, when he addressed my heart<br />
To new affections, he made these be high:<br />
And you, beloved children, thank you me<br />

For ne’er, undaunted heroes, did you yield<br />
Save to the greater number and adverse fate.<br />
Ye both, our century’s honour, have pursued<br />
The good of Italy and not your own.”</p>

<p class="p1">That my father was most right in saying, “And
where, immortal Pepe, leave I thee?” will be generally
allowed by persons cognizant of the facts. I
sincerely regret that he did not add, “And where,
immortal of immortals, Mazzini, leave I <i>thee</i>?” As
he did not add that, I must say a few words to account
for so grave an omission.</p>

<p>Mazzini did not settle in London until 1837. It
was inevitable that two such patriots and exiles as
Mazzini and Rossetti should know one another. There
was a great amount of mutual respect between them
(of which my Appendix furnishes ample proof), but
not anything like constant personal intercourse&mdash;in
fact, I do not recollect having even once seen Mazzini
in our house, but I have occasionally seen him elsewhere.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
To Italy and freedom they were equally
devoted, and the great conception of Italian unity was
present to the minds of both. But Mazzini was a
determined Republican, which Rossetti was not&mdash;being,
from the course of his experiences and reflections,
more in favour of a constitutional monarchy,
though by no means unsympathetic with the idea of
a Republic at the rare conjunctures when it emerged
as having some practical application: he was never a
member of the Giovine Italia. Mazzini was also, by
nature and circumstance, an incessant conspirator, and
promoted a number of unpromising and abortive insurrections,
foredoomed to failure, and viewed with
regret, and at times even with great repugnance, by
such Italians as were not committed to the extremest
forms of political theory and practice. It is no business
of mine to express an opinion whether Mazzini
or Rossetti was the more nearly in the right; but it
has always been my conviction that, had it not been
for the agitation so strenuously kept alive by the
sublime Genoese patriot, the emancipation and unifying
of Italy would not have taken place so soon as they
did.</p>

<p>It happened that towards 1850, when my father
was writing his Autobiography, he was particularly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
alienated from the policy pursued by Mazzini and his
adherents. The great revolutionary year, 1848, had
witnessed uprisings in various parts of Italy (an insurrection
in Messina had preceded the French Revolution
of February 1848 against Louis Philippe), followed
by a regular campaign between the Piedmontese and
the Austrians; this was renewed in 1849. In both
instances the Austrians were the victors; and many
patriotic Italians, including Rossetti, opined that this
disastrous result had in large measure been brought
about by a Mazzinian agitation (I will not pretend
to say how far Mazzini himself was personally responsible
for it) which repelled aid that might possibly
have been forthcoming from some foreign powers,
especially republican France, and denounced the
Piedmontese sovereign, Charles Albert, as covertly a
traitor to the Italian cause for which he was fighting.
I can thus understand a certain feeling on my father’s
part which, when he undertook to “sever the few
good from numerous bad,” among Italians “posed as
Liberals,” withheld him from expressly naming the
great protagonist of the national movement, Mazzini,
although he indisputably, in his own mind, included
him in the roll of “the few good.” Even so the
omission is to be regretted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>As to the question of Rossetti’s estimate of Republicanism
(to which, as I have already said, he
preferred, for practical purposes, a constitutional monarchy),
the following distinct profession of faith seems
worth preserving. Its date cannot be earlier than
June 1850, and is probably a little later. It was
written to introduce a poem&mdash;not, I think, any that
has been published.</p>

<p>“After having seen what is almost always the issue
of a democratic republic, more than once attempted
in Europe; having seen that, barbarous, sanguinary,
fratricidal, predaceous, and atheistic, in France in the
last century, it ended in the absolute despotism of
Bonaparte; and that, although mild, gentle, generous,
and believing, in our own century, it is about to merge
into the augmenting despotism of another Bonaparte,
who does not even possess the fascination of the
military and political successes and the talents of the
first; how can ever this blessed Republic still abide
in the hearts of so many Italians who sincerely love
their country? And yet it does abide.... And was
it not this desire which produced among us the discord
of minds in 1848, and caused all our subsequent
reverses? Oh if all the Italians had then unanimously
combined with Charles Albert to expel the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
common enemy from our sacred soil&mdash;oh if many inconsiderate
men had not, with the cry of ’Republic’
which they proclaimed with so much fervour, first
dismayed that sovereign, and afterwards damped his
enthusiasm for Italian independence&mdash;at this hour
not one German foot would be insolently stamping
our land, and Italy would not be such as she has
miserably returned to being. Pius IX. himself took
fright at that name; and, retreating from the glorious
path which he was already footing, he ended by
betraying us. A melancholy story this&mdash;which has
made, makes, and will make, all who love Italy shed
prolonged tears.</p>

<p>“‘But then you have no liking for a Republic?’
To any who ask me this, I shall answer: Yes, I like
it, and that far better than others do; but I like one
which would not have severed from us either Charles
Albert or Pius IX., and which would have conduced
to our obtaining that national independence that was
the ardent longing of all Italians.... I like that
Republic which alone can suit the interest of all, and
which alone seems capable of enduring in Italy, or
indeed in modern Europe.</p>

<p>“Whilst our hapless country had a prospect of good
success, I wrote these few extemporized octaves,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
which might furnish occasion for many notes, so as
to establish more fully what such a <i>Republic without
peril</i> ought to be&mdash;which I have always desired, and
now more than ever desire.... I felt my heart
touched in re-reading these stanzas; and, rude and
unpolished as they are, I yet transcribe them, so that
they may bear evidence that my soul did not participate
in that political offence which was the cause
of our disasters.”</p>

<p>After this rather long digression, I return to the
Autobiography, and its contrast between “the few
good” and the “numerous bad” Italians.</p>

<p class="pp6 p1">But ah how few there are that acted thus!<br />
With us a most repulsive crew combined,<br />
Seeking to fish in troubled water-streams.<br />
’Mong scanty good men many bad escaped,<br />
A show of baseness and of wretchedness:<br />
These brought dishonour on the refugees<br />
In French and Portuguese and Spanish soil;<br />
But here in England unexpectedly<br />
There came to settle down the best and worst.<br />
I grieved for famished men and mendicants<br />

I turn my indignant eye from such a horde.</p>

<p class="pp6 p1">And then reposefully my glance can pause<br />
Upon the upright whom Heaven has with me leagued,<br />
And who, inflamed with patriot charity,<br />
Reverberate on me their proper light.<br />
In a great cause we fell, and from that day<br />
We share the sacredness of Fortune’s blows.<br />

For all that’s mine he deems detestable,<br />
He prized my steadfast politics alone,<br />
And, joined with this, my blameless moral course:<br />
As for the rest, he wants all men to sniff<br />
In me the agreeable smell which donkeys yield.<br />
But wherefore in him did such rage collect?<br />
I know not, I: I saw him only once,<br />
When some one showed him to me in the street.</p>

<p class="pp6 p1">Italy, subject of mine every thought,<br />
Thine exiled son found kindness everywhere<br />
In hundreds of high-hearted foreigners:<br />
Only one exiled brother’s fatal hate ...<br />

For now I feel me on the bed of death.</p>

<p class="pp6 p1">It shall be brief indeed. What can I say?<br />
I will repeat with other sufferers&mdash;<br />
I leave my corpse to earth, my soul to God,<br />
Of whom I ask forgiveness of my sins.<br />
I trust in Christ, and cheer me with the thought<br />
That his true dogma I have tried to avow.<br />
I pardon all, yes all, my enemies.</p>

<p class="pp6 p1">More than one work of mine lies on my hands;<br />

For, having reached the arduous goal of life,<br />
A popular poet’s title I desire.<br />
The book I called <i>Arpa Evangelica</i>,<br />
Which aims the man-God’s worship to promote,<br />
Will prove&mdash;and would it were already in print!&mdash;<br />
Grateful to pious souls, I doubt not this.<br />
With what rapidity I wrote the book!<br />
It seemed as if I knew the whole by heart.<br />
Those hymns are not of all one calibre<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>But all of them evince a feeling soul.</p>

<p class="pp6 p1">I did it in three months&mdash;the vein ran quick.<br />
In volumes twain, where I make practical<br />

Eschewing style fantastic or bizarre<br />
’Gainst all despotic power I hurl my words.<br />

As ’twere, and thereon most I plume myself.<br />
In this the mystic diction I expound<br />
Of which I recollect I spoke before.<br />
A sample of it I printed ten years back<br />

<p>The desire for death, expressed in verse, was
genuinely present to Gabriele Rossetti’s mind. Ever
since the break-up of his health&mdash;which came to a
severe crisis in 1843, followed by partial blindness,
and that by many and increasing infirmities, paralytic
and other&mdash;he found life more burdensome than otherwise,
and would willingly have resigned it but for his
earnest wish to work for the benefit of his family.
Even the power of remunerative work failed towards
1847, when he had to resign his professorship at King’s
College. Troublous public events ensued; the tergiversation
of Pope Pius IX., the defeat of the Piedmontese
and other Italians by the Austrian armies, the crushing
of the Roman Republic by a French expedition. These<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
and other political occurrences greatly darkened the
closing years of Rossetti; and yet he was unconquerably
hopeful as to a more or less near future, and the result
justified his hopes.</p>

<p>I will summarize very briefly the events of his life
subsequent to the date of the Autobiography, say 1850.</p>

<p>Rossetti being now, by failure of health and eyesight,
debarred from professional work&mdash;though he always
continued diligent in no common degree as a writer,
principally in verse&mdash;the support of the family devolved
in large part on our mother, who went out teaching,
and at one time conducted a small day-school in
London. The four children were, at the end of 1850,
in this position:&mdash;Maria, aged twenty-three, a teacher
of Italian, French, etc.; Dante Gabriel, aged twenty-two,
a painter struggling to sell his pictures and make
a position; Christina, aged just twenty, assisting our
mother when the day-school was going on, otherwise
without regular employment; myself, aged twenty-one,
a clerk in the Inland Revenue Office and art-critic of
<i>The Spectator</i>&mdash;my earnings of course scanty, but on the
whole the least precarious among the slender resources
of the family. As the day-school in London brought
in no income worth speaking of, Mrs Rossetti, seeing
some prospect of an opening at Frome-Selwood,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
Somerset, started another day-school there in the
spring of 1853; her husband and Christina accompanied
her. This school proved no more successful
than its predecessor; and, as by the end of 1853 I
was beginning to advance a little in my office, I got
the family to re-unite in London from Lady-day 1854,
and had the satisfaction of housing my suffering father
in his last days. The house was named 45 Upper
Albany Street, Regent’s Park&mdash;later on, 166 Albany
Street. The end came very soon, 26th April 1854.</p>

<p>I subjoin here two obituary notices. The first was
written by Conte Giuseppe Ricciardi, on 1st May 1854,
and published in the <i>Opinione</i> of Turin. The second
was written by myself, and published in <i>The Spectator</i>,
6th May. In the latter there are a few details (of dates
etc.) which I now know to be not absolutely correct,
but I leave them as they stand. I could cite a great
number of other eulogistic tributes, more especially
since 1882, but need not launch out upon these.</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">(<i>a</i>) “Italian emigrants, and with the emigrants all Italy,
are constrained to mourn another loss. The earliest, the
most venerable, of the exiles, the illustrious Gabriele Rossetti,
died in London on the evening of 26th April, after a banishment
of thirty-three years&mdash;all of them spent in upholding
the sacred Italian cause....</p>

<p>“Rossetti, an extemporaneous poet already known and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
valued by the public at the date, 1820, when in Naples the
revolution broke out which came to such a wretched end
in the following year, composed, among other lyrics, the
splendid hymn, ’Sei pur bella cogli astri sul crine,’ to
which I find nothing to be compared except the other lyric
brought out by himself in London in 1831, beginning ‘Sù
brandisci la lancia di guerra’; and this too records another
hapless revolution!...</p>

<p>“It is needless to say that not a few writings of the
highly distinguished author remain unpublished; pre-eminent
among which are Parts II. and III. of his Comment on the
<i>Divine Comedy</i>. For this (shall I say it?) I have in vain,
up to the present date, sought out a publisher&mdash;so miserable
are the conditions of Italian literature.</p>

<p>“Rossetti, besides being, as all know, an eminent poet
and renowned scholar, was a fervent patriot, always most
constant to his principles, and a man of unsullied virtue,
so that he was revered even by his political enemies, and
no one ever ventured to assail his reputation in the least
degree; while all who came to have a little knowledge of
him soon got to love him.”</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) “Gabriele Rossetti, the most daringly original of the
commentators on Dante, died on the 26th ultimo, in London,
in his seventy-second year.</p>

<p>“Born on the 28th February 1783, in Vasto, a sea-coast
town in the Kingdom of Naples, he first visited the capital
in the capacity of secretary to the Marquis of Vasto, but
for the purpose of following, under the auspices of that
nobleman, the profession of a painter. His tastes soon took
a more decided bent, however, towards literature. He
developed a particular talent as a poetical improvisatore;
and his poems, both recited and written, gained him considerable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
reputation. For some while he held the official
post of poet to the Theatre of San Carlo. He afterwards
entered the Museo Borbonico, as sub-director of the collection
generally, and curator of the splendid sculptural
department,&mdash;a position which led him to devote especial
attention to the then fresh explorations at Pompeii and
Herculaneum. Here he remained for fifteen years; with an
interval of seven months, ending with the Pope’s return in
1813, during which he was at Rome, summoned thither by
Murat as a member of the Provisional Government. Courses
of lectures and literary instruction also occupied his time.
With the restoration of King Ferdinand came the spread
of Carbonarism; and Rossetti enrolled himself as a member
of that society of national reformers. The short-lived constitution
of 1821 succeeded&mdash;to expire in nine months;
leaving those who, like Rossetti, had hailed its advent with
enthusiasm, exposed to the rancour of tyrannic reaction. His
patriotic verses were his crime, and proved his rescue. The
wife of Admiral Sir Graham Moore had read and admired
them: the Admiral was then in Naples; and he prevailed
on the poet to terminate by flight the cruel suspense of
three months’ concealment, and to embark on board an
English vessel in the disguise of a lieutenant. His first
asylum was Malta, where he enjoyed and appreciated the
intimate friendship of the Right Honourable J. Hookham
Frere; two years afterwards he proceeded to England.</p>

<p>“In this country, occupied in teaching Italian, and holding
the Professorship at King’s College, he engaged deeply in
studies of the letter and spirit of Dante’s imperishable works.
The first-fruits of his labours appeared in the ‘Analytic
Comment’ on Dante, of which the opening part only, the
<i>Hell</i>, published in 1826 and 1827, has yet seen the light.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
Rossetti’s leading idea (indicated in this work, and enforced
in subsequent productions with the fervour of a discoverer,
vast literary diligence, and indefatigable minuteness of criticism)
is that Dante, in common with numberless other great
authors, wrote in a language of secret allegory, which embodies,
in the form now of love, now of mythology, now of alchemy,
now of freemasonry, the most daring doctrines in metaphysics
and politics. In 1832 was published his work
‘On the Anti-Papal Spirit which produced the Reformation,
and on the secret influence which it exercised over
the Literature of Europe, and especially of Italy, as is proved
by many of her Classics, Dante, Petrarch, and Boccaccio,
in particular,’ (<i>Sullo Spirito Antipapale</i>, etc.), a treatise
which was translated into English; in 1840, ‘The Mystery
of the Platonic Love of the Middle Ages, derived from the
Ancient Mysteries,’ (<i>Il Mistero dell’Amor Platonico</i>, etc.),
in five volumes; and in 1842, ‘A Critical Essay on Dante’s
Beatrice’ (<i>La Beatrice di Dante</i>), the concluding parts of
which remain in manuscript, but have recently, we understand,
been worked up into a Frenchified concoction, issued,
or to be issued, under the flaring title, <i>Dante Hérétique,
Républicain, et Socialiste</i>. Rossetti’s criticisms have been
much criticized. Fraticelli and Schlegel have been his
unmitigated opponents: Delécluze, in his <i>Amour du Dante</i>,
and the German philosopher Mendelssohn, promulgated,
without entirely committing themselves to, his views; an
Italian writer of credit, Vecchioni, has taken them up in
labours of his own; and Arthur Hallam, immortalized by
Tennyson’s <i>In Memoriam</i>, has left a respectful though
adverse essay on the subject. In addition to these works,
and others of minor account, four poetical volumes attest
both the constancy and the versatility of Rossetti’s powers,&mdash;<i>Il<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
Tempo</i>, <i>Salterio</i>, <i>Il Veggente in Solitudine</i>, <i>Versi</i>, and
<i>L’Arpa Evangelica</i>; the last published not many months
ago. Italy is not unmindful of his name.</p>

<p>“In private life Rossetti was thoroughly domestic and warm-hearted.
His family and literature formed his world, whence
the talents for society of which he possessed an ample share
could not withdraw him. No political exile leaves a memory
more highly above the whisper of public or private shame.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">Rossetti lies buried in Highgate Cemetery, with the
following inscription: “To the dear memory of my
husband, Gabriele Rossetti; born at Vasto d’Ammone
in the Kingdom of Naples, 28th February 1783; died in
London, 26th April 1854.” “He shall return no more
nor see his native country.”&mdash;Jer. xxii. 10. “Now they
desire a better country, that is an heavenly.”&mdash;Heb. xi.
16. “Ah Dio ajutami Tu.”</p>

<p>The concluding phrase formed the last emphatic
words which Rossetti pronounced in a loud voice, in
the evening of 25th April, after some hours of approximate
loss of speech. The remains of my mother, my
brother’s wife, and my sister Christina, are now interred
in the same grave. Towards 1871 a proposal was
pressed upon us for transporting my father’s remains
to Italy, for ceremonial re-interment there; but the
feeling of most members of the family was adverse,
and the project was not carried out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>The tone of the versified Autobiography&mdash;which is a
very genuine document of his character and feelings&mdash;shows
pretty well what manner of man Gabriele Rossetti
was; and in my Memoir of Dante Rossetti I have
given some details as to family-life and personal
habits. Here, therefore, I shall barely touch the fringe
of the subject. It is not for me to spy out every
infirmity in my father’s character; and, even were I
to try to do so, I should find nothing worse to allege
than a phase of self-esteem which at times trenched
upon self-complacency, a disregard of externals in
point of dress, etc., and an honourable (and, in the
circumstances which affected himself in England and
his family, a truly very requisite) habit of thriftiness
which made him count the cost of every personal indulgence,
while nothing expedient was stinted to his
wife and children. I know him to have been diligent,
indefatigable, upright, high-minded, affectionate, grateful,
placable, eminently good-natured, vivacious, cheerful
for the most part, friendly, companionable: whether
patriotic I need not say. Our excellent friend Dr
Adolf Heimann (Professor of German in University
College), writing to my brother a letter of condolence
on our father’s death, made the following observations,
which I consider just:&mdash;“I have never seen a more
devoted man of letters; endowed with some of the
rarest gifts of a literary character, real love for literature,
unworldliness, perseverance, and warmth of interest both
in writing and reading at an advanced time of life.
He might indeed have been a model to all of us. When
I look at all the great scholars and men of science
whom I have known, I do not remember one who
was so little satisfied with show as your father, who
was so content with a comparatively humble situation,
and so wonderfully patient in times of affliction.”</p>

<p>In person Gabriele Rossetti was barely up to middle
height, fleshy and full in contour until his health failed.
His eyes were dark and expressive, and did not alter
when his sight was damaged; his brow fine and well-rounded;
his nose, though not specially large, more
than commonly prominent, with wide nostrils. His
mouth was pleasant and nicely moulded, with a winning
smile, and on occasion a laugh of the heartiest.</p>

versified Autobiography, and shall proceed to give some
further illustrative matter in the form of five Appendices.</p>

<p class="p1">1. Extracts from six of the domestic letters of
Gabriele Rossetti.</p>

<p class="p1">I give these letters (translated by me) for what they are
worth; not as being of any singular degree of interest in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
the topics which they raise, or in the mode of treating these,
but chiefly for the purpose of showing what was the prevalent
and constant tone of Rossetti in his family-relations. Two
of his children, Dante Gabriel and Christina Georgina, have
turned out to be of some moment to the British public, and
some hint of their childish or youthful doings will be here
found. In these letters I leave some gaps: in the great
majority of cases this is only done because the omitted
passages are of no importance. Holmer Green, the locality
to which the first five letters are addressed, is in Buckinghamshire,
near Little Missenden and Amersham: Gaetano Polidori,
my maternal grandfather, along with his family, resided
there for several years. The final letter was addressed to
Mrs Rossetti at Brighton.</p>

<h3 id="c117">A.</h3>

<p>[Mr Potter, here mentioned, was Mr Cipriani Potter,
Principal of the Royal Academy of Music, a distinguished
pianist, and composer of pianoforte-music. He was my godfather,
and his family was the only British family of which our
household saw a goodish deal in these early years. I infer
that “the drama” which my father had written, and which
was to be paid for with £40, was a set of scenes named
<i>Medora e Corrado</i> (after Byron’s <i>Corsair</i>),&mdash;Mr Potter having
been concerned in composing music to these scenes: such
a sum as £40 appears to be ample remuneration for it.
“Mrs Fitch” was our servant at this date: I have naturally
no recollection of Dante Gabriel’s performance which amused
her, nor yet of Signor Barile. Henry and Charlotte, named
along with Barile, were my Uncle and Aunt: also Robert and
Eliza.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dearest Frances</span>,</p>
<p class="pi12">No doubt you have been indignant at
my long silence, full fourteen days. Don’t attribute it to want
of love, but to my wish to write you something which might
partly relieve the anxiety which you only too much share
with me. Know therefore, dear wife, that our affairs are
proceeding less amiss. At the present date I have seventeen
lessons a week, and I am expecting others.... Mr Potter,
who sends his best regards, saw me this morning, and he told
me that Mrs Howard also will soon resume her lessons; and
he expressly added, of his own accord, that it seems to be time
for him to give me the £40 for the drama. I hope to put
you, on your return, in possession of some £80 at home; and
perhaps we shall be getting as much at the end of the season.
Be in good spirits then, Frances mine, because that God who
gives nourishment to worms in the earth will not abandon us,
with our four little children, innocent and in need.</p>

<p>I have not slackened in trying for King’s College, and
many persons have interested themselves in my behalf. The
Principe di Cimitile, who recommended me to some member
of the Council of the College, learned from him that the
election of Professors depends chiefly on the Bishop of
London; and I quickly procured two letters of introduction
to the Bishop. Mr Barclay, who is his intimate friend, gave
me one, and the other came from Sir Gore Ouseley, who has
also handed me two others for two patrons of the College. I
trust that Providence will second my efforts.</p>

<p>The affairs of Italy also resume a better aspect; and it is
officially notified that the French Government has sent a
representative to Rome, to dissuade from shedding the blood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
of the poor patriots, who have behaved with admirable
moderation. Poland is darting like a thunderbolt against
Russia.</p>

<p>Two or three days after your departure I received another
letter from Mr Lyell, in which he asks me briefly to suspend
sending him the MS. you wot of, as he was about
to start for a different part of England; adding that by
the end of a month he would come in person to see us in
London. I fancy that he has gone to present himself as a
candidate for the new Parliament. People are all in motion
for this purpose; but it seems that Reform will triumph, and
the anti-reformers will get more and more into the mire. God
forbid that this Bill should not pass&mdash;there would certainly be
a revolution. All say so, and the symptoms are manifest....</p>

<p>I trust that you and our children have always been well:
speak of them to me one by one when you write. I was so
much pleased at what you told me about Gabriel in your
last; and it made Mrs Fitch laugh so that she recounted it
to all who came here&mdash;Henry, Charlotte, and also Signor
Barile.... Salute cordially for me Robert and Eliza: God
give them patience with those four babbykins, and especially
with that dear impertinent, Gabriel. In your last you told
me nothing about either William or Christina: make up for
your omission. Every syllable you write about them is a boon
to me....</p>

<p>[Mr Tallent, here mentioned, was the medical adviser of
the family at Holmer Green; Mr MacIntyre (living near
Portland Place) was often consulted towards this time in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
London. About Maestro Negri and the drama I have no
clear idea: possibly it was <i>Il Corsaro</i>, for Rossetti wrote
some “Scene Melodrammatiche” under this title, as well as
the “Cantata Melodrammatica” of <i>Medora e Corrado</i>. The
person termed “Mr Charles” was the painter Mr (afterwards
Sir) Charles Locke Eastlake: “my new work,” which he
admired, was the <i>Spirito Antipapale</i>.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dearest Frances</span>,</p>

<p class="pi12">... I should indeed like to see our
skittish Christina, with those rosy cheeks and sparkling eyes,
so like her grandmother’s, walking all alone about the garden,
like a little butterfly among the flowers. I hope that, thanks
to the beneficial change of air, I shall soon see her still
prettier and still healthier than you describe her to me now.
To tell you the truth, I think Mr Tallent’s advice is better
than Mr MacIntyre’s. It is high time to wean her.... You
cannot think how much pleasure those childish English words
which you gathered from the lips of Maria and Gabriel gave
me. If they are truthful, I thank Heaven that they are good
children, and that they do not tire your mother too much
with their noise and their impudence. I mean to send them
some new little picture-books which will amuse them; and
also a box of figs, in order that you may at times reward
their good behaviour and satisfy their small greed. Poor
little things! They used to await my return home so eagerly,
so as to receive the trifles I had brought them! And now
neither they nor I have that pleasure....</p>

<p>This evening Casella arrived here quite out of breath to
announce that the King has again dismissed the Duke of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
Wellington from the ministry, and has recalled Lord Grey
with all his ministerial following; thus rectifying the error
he had committed. And indeed he could not act otherwise
in order to calm the huge agitation which was on foot
throughout the country, and principally in this metropolis.
The Duke of Wellington has had the mortification of being
unable to find any one who would consent to form the Cabinet
with him; Sir Robert Peel refused, Lord Aberdeen refused;
all refused when they perceived the peril in which they would
place themselves. A pretty figure they have cut&mdash;the great
Captain and His Majesty,&mdash;this latter so changeable and
deceitful, and the former first deserted and then sent about
his business! It is a hard task to oppose the will of a whole
people. It is just 11 o’clock as I write to you, and I hear
“<i>The Courier</i>, fourth edition,” being called out by several
voices past the house....</p>

<p>Let us take heart, Providence will not forsake us. You
know, my wife, that we have had recent proofs of its assistance;
here is another. Yesterday the son of the Maestro
Negri called on me bringing me the answer from those
young ladies who, as you know, wished for a drama; he
showed me a letter from them in which the matter is revived.
I have had to lower my price, however, and content myself
with thirty guineas....</p>

<p>Two days ago, a great Italian littérateur, Professor Orioli,
head of the Bologna University, and head of the Italian
Government during last year’s revolution, visited me, and
paid me a great compliment on my new work. Mr Scrope,
with whom I dined last Saturday, also said some very laudatory
things about it, which he based on the opinion of
<i>Mr Charles</i>, who had read it; the latter afterwards expressed
his admiration to me in person. Last week I wrote two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
long letters to Malta to thank Mr and Miss Frere for their
very opportune generosity, which saved us from imminent
anxieties.</p>

<p>The day before yesterday I bought myself a pair of spectacles,
which I felt badly in need of; and now, if you could
see what an imposing figure I cut, and what a grave air
they give me, it would inspire even you with respect. When
you return you will certainly take me for a president. I
will not tell you how much they cost, because you would
immediately conclude that my spectacles were bad, and yet
they serve their purpose wonderfully well....</p>

<p>Hitherto my stupid prophecy has not been at all fulfilled,
and this letter is witness to the fact: and I pray to God
that he may not fulfil it till I have been able, with your help,
to educate and give a start in life to our four dear offshoots,
who have rendered life extremely dear to me; and I hope
to pass it in your sweet company, in that reciprocal affection
which has hitherto bound us together....</p>

<p>[The “garden” here spoken of is the enclosure of Park
Square, Regent’s Park; I can remember being in it more than
once in early childhood. Sangiovanni, a strange impetuous
southern Italian, was now an artist-modeller in clay. Dr
Maroncelli was a brother of the prisoner who was sent to the
Spielberg along with Silvio Pellico, as recorded in Pellico’s
book, once highly celebrated, <i>Le Mie Prigioni</i>. “My letter
for the King of Naples” appears to have been a memorial
or petition. Pistrucci (Filippo) had been run down in London<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>

his life, which terminated towards 1857.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dearly loved Frances</span>,</p>

<p class="pi12">I would that I had not received
your letter this time, although I had looked forward to it and
desired it so eagerly. Every word you wrote pierced like a
dagger into my heart. My sweetest Gabriel, then, is so
ill! My baby Christina suffers with her teeth and has
wounded her forehead! Oh my poor children! If the
distance were less great, I would come immediately to see
my four treasures, and you, my beloved wife, who must be
immensely afflicted, as I am myself. And William, you tell
me nothing about him. You told me in your last letter that
he had a return of those fevers from which he suffered here:
and now, how is that going on?&mdash;how is he? As you do
not speak about it, I will hope and trust that he has
recovered. Be good enough, dear Frances, to write to me
at once and tell me all about them; hide from me nothing,
absolutely nothing. I wish to know the facts, be they
better or be they worse.... I beg you, I beg you urgently,
to return immediately if Gabriel’s condition permits. I
wish to share with you the care of my bantlings. I would
never have written you this but for this painful circumstance,
but would have been content to remain a cheerless hermit for
another month; but, now that I see that your presence instead
of improving only aggravates the condition of your honoured
mother to whom we owe every consideration, now that I see
that our children, instead of benefiting by the country air,
have rather derived harm from it (although I ought perhaps to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
attribute this to other causes), I should feel dreadfully anxious
if you remained any longer away from me. Who knows but
what the figs I sent may have done them harm! But this
constant change of weather has more likely been the cause,
first hot, then cold, now hot again. This belief is strengthened
by your telling me that Maria and Christina have sore throats....
I should be the most frantic and inconsolable man in
the world if I were to lose a son, that dearest little Gabriel, the
very core of my heart, and lose him thus, far from my sight.
My eyes are already full of tears whilst writing these words,
and unless I dry them I cannot continue writing, as I do not
see the paper. But take heart, my wife, it may turn out to be
nothing serious.</p>

<p>Here, meanwhile, is one cause for rejoicing. I have already
obtained the key of the garden for which you so often
wished.... I have already been five times for a stroll in
the garden, the first time alone, the second time with Polidori,
the third with him and Sangiovanni, the fourth again with
him and Doctor Maroncelli, one of those two who called
on me one evening in company with Lablache. This walk
is very convenient, and the children will find plenty of space
to walk and run about here and there....</p>

<p>I have already written three scenes of that play for the
young ladies, which I have given to the son of Maestro
Negri....</p>

<p>Count Lucchesi has told me a thing which he had never
mentioned to me before. When he went with my letter to
the King of Naples, about which you heard, he found the
Minister of Naples reading my last work, dedicated to Mr Lyell.
The Minister said to him: “What a talented man this Rossetti
is! You see what persons the government of Naples exiles!”
It is well, dear Frances, that this diplomatist should not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
be ignorant of what I have written; and, if it is granted me
to return to my country, before doing so I will send the work
to the King of Naples, so that he will not be able to say later
on that I had committed some old faults of which he was
unaware. On Friday I dined with that painter whom I
described to you by the name of Mr Charles....</p>

<p>I will close this letter begging you again to write to me
at once, during the course of this week. Remember that
until I hear from you again I shall be extremely agitated.
Don’t conceal anything from me, I repeat. If you did so,
you would force me to rush off to you like a madman, to
ascertain with my own eyes the real state of things. Besides
which it might cause me a somewhat serious ill; since for
some six days I have felt distressing and strong symptoms
of gout, which causes me much uneasiness. I needn’t ask
you to look after the children, because I hold it unnecessary;
I know you too well. I doubt whether there lives a better
mother than you, and a wife more amiable and affectionate
has yet to be born. And so your husband idolizes you, and
his sincerest love increases with years, and he considers
himself fortunate in possessing such a rare woman.</p>

<p>Goodbye, dearly loved Frances, I am going to bed for it
is one o’clock. I bless one by one the infant pledges of our
love, and invoke on them health and prosperity. Kiss them
for me, speak about me to them, and&mdash;along with theirs&mdash;preserve
your precious health, which is my greatest treasure.</p>

<p>Yesterday poor Pistrucci wrote me a letter which really is
fit to make one weep. He says he is suffering horrible
torments, and it has been discovered that his thigh was broken
in three parts, so that he is crippled. Poor man!</p>

<p>[I have no recollection of the Marchesa Marchigiana, nor
of Signor Ferri. The physiognomical estimate of Signor
Janer is curious, because that gentleman, a cultivated
Tuscan whom we saw continually in these years, was regarded
as somewhat prone to backbiting; he was always,
however, on good terms with my father and his family, and
I should say that he was really amicable with all of us.

<p class="pi12">... At the moment of my writing a
very deluge is coming down&mdash;lightning, thunder, buckets of
water. I am sorry for poor Gabriel, who is out for a walk
with Henry....</p>

<p>That Marchesa Marchigiana left yesterday morning (Sunday),
and in the last two days she called on me thrice. On the
evening of Saturday she came at eight, and left at midnight.
She talked for ten. She expressed great concern for your illness,
and exclaimed several times&mdash;“Oh, if I had seen her, I would
have made her know what a husband she possesses!” To
hear her, I am the idol of Italy. She knows by heart a great
quantity of my verses, some of which I had as good as forgotten.
Suffice it to say that she knows more of them than
Curci, and is more enthusiastic than Curci about me and my
doings. But the greatest wonder is that she recites long
snatches of my <i>Analytic Comment on the Divina Commedia</i>.
She told me that, being unable to procure it in print (as it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
is prohibited in Italy), she copied it all out from one that
was lent her in secret. That many other people have done
the like. That of my <i>Salterio</i> (the <i>whole</i> of which she truly
knows by heart) she is acquainted with a great number of
manuscript copies. That in Rome a liberal Monsignore
named Muzzarelli has, like herself, copied it out, and learned
it off. That, were I to return, in passing through Romagna,
youthful admirers would come about me in shoals, and would
unharness the horses from my carriage to drag me in triumph.
Matter for laughter! Sangiovanni, who was present at all this
(which I can but suppose exaggerated), had to wipe his eyes
from time to time&mdash;the loving friend. In short, dear Frances,
without your having observed it nor yet myself, you have as
husband the greatest man of Italy, indeed the idol of Italy!
Who would ever have fancied it?</p>

<p>The best of it is that another gentleman from Lugo has
arrived, Conte Carducci, who brings me a letter from Comendator
Borgia (a descendant of that scoundrel Alexander VI.),
and both Carducci and Borgia speak to me in the same
style.... This shows once again that the physical optics
are the reverse of the imaginary; for, as by physics distant
objects seem to us small, so by imagination small objects,
the further off they are, seem the larger. I should be almost
afraid of returning, even if I could, so that I might not verify
that saying, <i>Minuit præsentia famam</i>.</p>

<p>The Marchesa gave us a proof of her physiognomic science
which made me and Sangiovanni laugh a great deal. She
saw here Janer, whom she knew not in the least, and who
showed her a thousand civilities. After Janer had left, she,
who had treated him distantly, called me aside, and said:
“Beware of that man, who has the face of a great intriguer
and a very cunning fellow.” Isn’t this queer?...</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>With her came a very handsome young man from Fermo,
named Ferri, nephew of Cardinal Ferri. He, on hearing the
nature of your illness, spoke of one of his of the same class,
from which he has recovered to the most perfect health.
He was reduced, as he described it, to a truly deplorable
condition, from which he rallied by continual exercise; and
if one sees him now!</p>

<p class="pn1">(old verses of mine). So, my dear Frances, take as much
exercise as you can....</p>

<p>Lo and behold, the day is again beautiful, and what a
brilliant sun! Truly the climate of London is more changeable
than a Frenchwoman. Gabriel is knocking with that
double knock of his like the postman. I trust he avoided
the rain under some shelter&mdash;will go and ask. He has
returned all drenched, and Margaret will make him change
clothes....</p>

<p>I embrace you, and bless Maria. Repeat to her that her
letter gave me great pleasure; and tell her that I expect one in
Italian, which will serve not only to show me how you are,
when you don’t want to be writing yourself, but also to keep
her in the practice of the language of “the beautiful land.”

<p class="pi12">Ever since you informed us that the
day of your longed-for return would be the 25th of this
October (which will complete two full months of your absence)
we have never ceased to count, every day, how many days
remain before reaching the one which is to restore you to us.
The most steady computer of this sum is Christina. This
morning, barely just out of bed, she came in great glee into
the room where I was studying, and the first words she spoke
were these&mdash;“Not counting to-day, only three days remain”
(you will understand that the day of my writing is Friday

Mr Lyell, to paint an oil-portrait of our father; he was now,
after some seeming neglectfulness, giving full attention to the
matter. The portrait, nearly his first painting, turned out a

<p>I had hoped yesterday to see Pistrucci, whom I supposed
likely to come to London, to promote the concert for the
benefit of the Italian School. But I was disappointed. I
trust he was not offended at that outburst I sent him regarding
the demagogues who have contributed to the present
ruin of Italy. He, as the perfectly sincere patriot whom all
men recognize, must deplore, or rather detest, whatever
can have been a cause of the pitiful state to which our
country is reduced. But let us hope that the disaster is
reparable, and I am certain that his heart desires this no
less fervently than my own. I am aware of the glorious
event at Bologna, where the Germans got a good lesson.
May this be the glorious beginning of a still more glorious
re-arising! I know that France and England have become
mediators between Italy and Austria in this bloody strife;
may they be sincere and effectual mediators for the good of
both, and may the <i>reasonable liberty</i> of our poor country

Charles Lyell, Kinnordy</span></p>

<p class="p1">[As to Mr Lyell, see p. 72. I give the following extracts,
bearing upon Rossetti’s theories and speculations regarding
Dante and a great number of other writers, not because I
suppose him to have been constantly right in detail, nor even
as adopting his views in a broad sense, but because the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
allegations which he here puts forward are certainly both
curious and startling; and they formed so intimate a portion
of his thought and life, chiefly between the years 1825 and
1842, that no true picture of him could be given without
taking matters of this kind into account. The correspondence
between Mr Lyell and my father was frequent, and
often lengthy. I used to possess the general bulk of the
letters written by Mr Lyell, and had been authorized by the
present head of the family, Sir Leonard Lyell, to use, in a
compilation which I was undertaking, extracts from many of
them. In 1898, however, an interchange took place between
Sir Leonard and myself; and I now own the letters which
my father wrote, in lieu of letters coming from Mr Lyell. In
comparison with the full extent of these Rossetti epistles,
the extracts which I give are a mere trifle. I have selected
not always the most important passages, but such as tend to
show the very wide range along which he applied his
theory of a covert, esoteric, and perilous meaning in the
writings of authors of many centuries and many nations.
Copies of Rossetti’s letters to Lyell, one hundred and twenty-eight
in number, are deposited in the Taylor Institution,
Oxford; the copying was done by Signor de Tivoli.</p>

<p>There is another copious correspondence which my father
carried on regarding the like topics&mdash;that with Mr Hookham
Frere. I possess the letters of Mr Frere appertaining to this
correspondence, and also (through the courtesy of Mr John
Tudor Frere and Miss Festing) those of Rossetti. I had
at one time thought of publishing ample extracts from this
series; but ultimately I found it more suitable to place the
correspondence at the disposal of Miss Festing, who, in her
interesting book named <i>John Hookham Frere and his
Friends</i> (1899), has drawn upon it so far as was consistent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
with her scheme. She has also quoted the passage in
verse about Hookham Frere (see p. 60 of the present work).
Miss Festing naturally did not publish all the letters <i>in
extenso</i>, nor even so much of them as I had at first proposed
to extract. Several passages which Miss Festing did
not use seem well worthy of being printed at some time or
another&mdash;Mr Hookham Frere’s letters, not to speak of my
father’s, being capital reading; at present, however, I leave
all this aside, chiefly with a view to condensing my whole
account of Gabriele Rossetti into a moderate space.]</p>

records and documents, researches into works in the sect-language,<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>
treatises on the use of the sect-language; in fine,
I have as much as would make all our adversaries remain
frost-bound and mute. And to me it is a kind of enigma
to see how matters so multiple, so consentaneous, so palpable,
which have been going on in a lapse of six centuries
(from Frederick II. up to our time), have not ever been either
discerned or revealed. There is not the least doubt that that
Emperor projected a change of religion, and the destruction
of the Roman Church. The Popes had no alternative but
either to destroy him and his party, or else to be themselves
destroyed, and their cult with them. That opinion of Foscolo,
regarded by all as a fantasy, which led him to say that <i>Dante<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
wished to change the religion</i>, is a certain fact; and his fantasy
consists only in his having supposed that this was an idea
of Dante’s own, and not that of a most numerous, most
potent, and most wide-spread sect, upheld by men of great
power....</p>

<p>Never will I set it down, <i>never</i>, that there was a project
of expelling Jesus Christ from the altars&mdash;only that there
was a project for restoring His worship to its primitive
simplicity, and that they profaned the Catholic doctrine by
a concerted phraseology which involved a political scheme.
Wherefore scandalize the world by the revelation of a daring
purpose which may do discredit to illustrious authors, and
bring down upon myself the ill-will of the sect which still
exists, and has power and influence in the social world? The
fact is that the true intention of that secret society, to which
belonged all the authors whom I am engaged in examining,
manifested itself plainly in the effects of the French Revolution
at the close of last century....</p>

<p>Reghellini says openly that Dante’s poem is a Masonic
poem; and, before he wrote this, I had already seen it
for myself....</p>

<p>I have also made some examination of English poetry&mdash;that
of the time of Cromwell; I know, however, and know
for certain, that Chaucer is in the same boat....</p>

<p class="pi12">... It is impossible to continue without
exhibiting the most intimate mysteries of the sect, seeing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
that the entire poem of Dante, all the lyrics of Petrarca,
almost all the works of Boccaccio, and, in fine, all the old
writings of that class, are nothing else than <i>downright doctrine
and practice of the Freemasons</i>, in the strictest acceptation
of the word. Such was the Gay Science, such the Platonic
love, such the sect of the Templars, and that of the Paulicians.
How true this is you will find in the published volume,<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> with
numberless manuscript additions which I have made to it....
There you will see developed the God of the Sect&mdash;viz. Man
in Freedom; there, also, the Sectarian Trinity, the Incarnation,
Transubstantiation, and other matters.... But it
is dangerous to consign the work to the public, and
the chief danger is this: The demonstration cannot be
<i>rightly</i> founded, so as to defy confutation, without citing
in confirmation the writings of St Paul and those of St
John. One might make use of protests, dexterity, or even
hypocrisy, but none the less one must state the thing
which is; and, if one will not state this, one is compelled to
stop short at the effects, and leave the cause unexplained,
which makes less visible and tangible the reality of the
assumption....</p>

<p>I see with regret that the assertion of many Sectarian writers,
and among others of Swedenborg, is not without foundation&mdash;namely,
that the religion founded upon the New Testament
is, in fact, the religion which they profess, of which <i>we</i> practise
the letter, and <i>they</i> possess the spirit: we are the outer church,
and they form the hereditary priesthood. Be this true or
false, great indeed is the illusion which it assails;<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> and to bring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
this to light would be an offence against the human society
in which we exist....</p>

<p>I now comprehend why the <i>Mysterium Magnum</i> was never
manifested to the world. It is confided to very few persons,
of well-approved prudence, and at an age of thorough maturity;
and to discover it by one’s own scrutiny is a work of immense
labour, and (I will venture to say) of no ordinary talent....
I know that Mr Frere belongs to the secret order; and, having
perceived what it is that I have already discovered by analysis
and reasoning, he fears lest I should reveal it to the world.
I am not so mad as to plan detriment to society, and to
myself....</p>

<p>With regard to the chapter, <i>Dante personified in Adam</i>,
this, though not demonstrated in full, has none the less a
great basis of proofs in other chapters; and its substance
is that Dante was the inventor of that simulated religious
language. Perhaps, on reading some additions which I have
made, you will more strongly feel the reality of the thesis....</p>

<p>In these recent days I have made some most important
discoveries in the <i>Convito</i>: of these I will give you a hint,
but only a hint, as the thing would be lengthy to expound.
Being persuaded that the <i>Convito</i> is the exposition, in the
sect-language, of the <i>Commedia</i> and its secrets, I, observing
that Dante dwells so much upon explaining the cosmographical
construction of heaven and earth, and confident that
he must be speaking of his poem, have been minded to follow
the track which he indicates; and I have found (<i>mirabile
dictu!</i>) that all corresponds to the poem. Begin reading at
p. 153 (Zatta’s edition), here at the end; “This heaven turns
round this centre continually,” etc.; all that he says&mdash;verily
all&mdash;expounds the arcane structure of his poetic machinery,
and discloses its secret device....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Very dear Sir and Excellent Friend</span>,</p>

<p class="pi12">... The interpretation of the <i>Vita Nuova</i>
depends upon knowing what portions of it are to be taken
first, and what portions are to be taken last. This enigmatic
booklet contains thirty-three compositions (<i>vide</i> your Index),
relating to the thirty-three cantos of each section of the
<i>Commedia</i>. These thirty-three poetic compositions are to be
divided into three parts, according to those three sections,
and to the three predominant canzoni of the <i>Vita Nuova</i>.
The central canzone, which is “Donna pietosa,” is the head<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
of the skein, and from that point must the interpretation
begin; and then one must take, on this side and on that, the
four lateral sonnets to the left, and the four to the right&mdash;(the
last one to the right has been somewhat altered by Dante,
with the designation of one stanza of an incomplete canzone,
but it is in fact a sonnet, as I will prove)&mdash;and the one set
of sonnets will explain the other set; and it will be seen
that the death of Beatrice’s father, set forth on the left side,
and the death of Beatrice herself, set forth on the right side,
of the central canzone, mean one and the same thing. This
is the first part of the enigma.</p>

<p>On this side and on that follow the two canzoni, placed
symmetrically&mdash;viz. “Donne che avete intelletto d’amore” on
the left, and “Gli occhi dolenti per pietà del core” on the
right. In the former it is decided that Beatrice is to die;
in the second, Beatrice dead is lamented; and the one
canzone explains the other. And thus, proceeding from one
side to the other, collating the ten compositions to the right
with the ten to the left, we come finally to the first and the
last sonnets of the <i>Vita Nuova</i>, which contain two visions;
and the last vision, “Oltre la spera che più larga gira,” explains
the first vision, “A ciascun’alma presa e gentil core.”
When the interpretation goes on these lines, this sonnet
becomes as clear as possible. Dante, assuming his reader
to be already cognizant of the mystical language, and to
be capable of solving by this process his work which has
the character of a knot, wrote: “The true judgment as to
the said sonnet was not then seen by any one, but now it
is manifest to the simplest.”... The central part [of the
<i>Vita Nuova</i>], which constitutes the Beatrice Nine,<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> consists<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
of nine compositions&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> the central canzone, with four
sonnets on one side and four on the other....</p>

<p>Recently I have been applying myself to a study of the
first Holy Fathers of the primitive Church; and they say
plainly that they, in the inner Sacerdotal School, explained
the <i>mysteries</i> of religion, protesting at the same time that
they could reveal nothing of this to the profane. I have
passages from St Basil, a light of the Greek Church, which
show that these personages acted like the gentile school....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Very dear Sir and Friend</span>,</p>

<p class="pi12">... The object or system of
the secret school, in explaining the mysteries, is to show that
those whom we take for beings existing outside of ourselves,
and who are represented to us as such by the Christian
doctrine, are none other than our internal ideas or affections;
that is to say, that those supernatural personages who are
exhibited to men as divine are the human faculties themselves,
personified by ancient secret art; and that these
figurative personages merge the one into the other, and
interpenetrate and unify in one sole being&mdash;namely, in Man.
The ultimate revelation.</p>

<p>This is equally the system of Dante, both in the <i>Divine
Comedy</i> and in the <i>Vita Nuova</i>&mdash;which latter gives the keys
of the former....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>Origen and Tertullian, as well as Synesius, Bishop of
Cyrene, give in the sect-language the keys to the whole New
Testament, and partly to the Old:... the selfsame explanation
which is given in the mysteries of the present
still-subsisting sect.</p>

<p>From the writings of the latter I gather that the secret
school of the Christian priesthood is continued by Masonry;
that one of the heads of the school in Constantine’s time,
Sylvester, came to an understanding with that despot to
suppress the secret explanation, and to retain merely the
formula of the external figures, which understanding produced
the papacy or priesthood of Rome; but that other chiefs of
the same school, indignant at his having sold the interests
of mankind to the secular power, severed themselves from
him and persisted in the secret teaching,&mdash;which went on
to the late ages (and here we arrive at Dante), and so continued
up to our own times.</p></div>

to you my misdeed: in that which you have read, or which you
will be reading, I have suppressed all those passages of the
authorities that I quote which exhibit the secret overtly. I
have quoted in a maimed form Petrarca, Boccaccio, and
especially Swedenborg.... For example, this Swede writes
that the entire Bible, both the Old Testament and the New,
is written in that selfsame language in which he writes, and that
his is none other than a prolongation of that. He says that
the Prophets saw God no otherwise than he saw him; that
there is no other future life than that which he describes,
in which one dies a man, and revives as an angel to a new
life; that there are not any other heavens nor another God
than those to which he ascended, and that with whom he
spoke; and other similar things: all of them expunged by
me, even in the thick of the citation which I make. These
utterances of his may have illuded the world, before it was
understood, by giving the keys, what heaven is, and what the
angels and God are; but, the keys having been given, the
propositions become horrible and scandalous....</p>

three parts, and expounds mysticism in mystic language,
somewhat less obscure than in the ancient works of like kind.
In the first part he introduces a certain Louis Lambert as expounder

invidiosi veri”:<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> in the third he introduces a nephew

l’homme parvient au ciel.” (Vol. II. p. 102.) And so on
to a large extent. What seems to me most noticeable is to
see Dante and Swedenborg put on the same footing. And
Reghellini says plainly that Dante was a Freemason (<i>vide</i>
Vol. III. pp. 48, 49). And Ragon affirms the same (pp.
290-332)....</p>

Kirkup to Gabriele Rossetti</span></p>

<p class="p1">[Mr Seymour Kirkup, an English painter and man of
letters established in Florence, became an enthusiastic
adherent to Rossetti’s scheme of Dantesque interpretation,
from reading his Comment on the <i>Inferno</i> and his <i>Spirito
Antipapale</i>. In his later years he was made a Barone of
the Italian Kingdom, and he died at a great age towards
1880. The following extracts relate chiefly to the deeply
interesting discovery, in which he bore a very principal
part, of the portrait of Dante by Giotto in the Chapel of
the Podestà, in the Bargello of Florence.]</p>

Sonnet, “O della mente eterna immago e prole.” It is very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
beautiful. It is capital. Let me thank you very sincerely,
and let me congratulate you on Germany being about to
enjoy the benefit of your invaluable discoveries. Every new
country is a triumph of your cause; and, whilst all Europe
will be benefiting by your genius and learning, Italy alone
remains without an Italian edition of the original Italian
work on the great luminary of Italy and of the world. In
Florence there are too many obstacles: the priests, and the
antiquated routine imbecility of the Crusca. The word-mongers
are all envious. They are true bran, and well sifted
from the fior di pensieri. They are old, and find your
success a reproach, and in this country all hue and cry
raised against innovation is supported by force. The tone
of the court and the police is carried into the Academies.
Well may you say “L’Italia invidia omai fin la Turchia.”</p>

<p>I have delayed writing in the hopes of sending you a
sketch which will interest you, but I have hitherto been disappointed.
We have made a discovery of an original portrait
of Dante in fresco by Giotto! Although I was a magna
pars in this undertaking, the Jacks in Office have not allowed
me yet to make a copy. Sono tanto gelosi, most likely afraid
I should publish it and prevent some friends of their own
reaping all the profit they hope from that speculation.</p>

<p>I was the person who first mentioned to Sig. Bezzi, a
Piedmontese and friend of Carlo Eastlake’s, the existence of
the portrait under the whitewash of three centuries. We were
joined by an American, and we three undertook at our expense
to employ a restorer to uncover the walls of the old
chapel in the palace of the Podestà in search of the portrait&mdash;mentioned
by F. Villani, Filelfo, L. Aretino, Vasari, Cinelli,
etc. Nothing but the constancy and talent of Sig. Bezzi
could have overcome the numberless obstacles and refusals<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
we met with. He wrote and spoke with the persuasions of
an advocate, and persevered with the obstinacy and activity
of an Englishman (which I believe he now is). He alone
was the cause of success. We should have had no chance
without him. At last, after uncovering enough of three walls
to ascertain it was not there, the Government took the task
into their own hands, on our terms, with the same restorer,
and in the fifth wall they have succeeded. The number of
walls is six, for the chapel has been divided in two&mdash;(magazines
of wine, oil, bread, etc., for the prisoners).</p>

<p>The precise date of the painting is not known. The poet
looks about 28&mdash;very handsome&mdash;un Apollo colle fattezze di
Dante. The expression and character are worthy of the subject,
and much beyond what I expected from Giotto. Raphael
might own it with honour. Add to which it is not the mask
of a corpse of 56&mdash;a ruin&mdash;but a fine, noble image of the
Hero of Campaldino, the Lover of Beatrice. The costume
very interesting&mdash;no beard or even a lock of hair.</p>

<p>A white cap, over which a white capuccio, lined with dark
red showing the edge turned back. A parchment book under
his arm&mdash;perhaps the Vita Nuova.</p>

<p>It is in a group of many others&mdash;one seems Charles II.
of Naples. Brunetto Latini and Corso Donati are mentioned
by the old authors.</p>

<p>I send herewith a pamphlet by Prof. Nannucci&mdash;very
curious and very interesting respecting Dante&mdash;and a dose
for the Crusca.</p>

<p>I wrote to you by Mr Craufurd, who took charge of the
medal, and sent two pamphlets by him, one for Mr Taylor&mdash;and
two letters of thanks, one to him and one to Mr Lyell;
but I fear by what you say in your last letter you have never
received them. Mr C[raufurd] is a friend of Eastlake’s, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
can perhaps get them for you. I liked Mr Taylor’s book<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>
very much indeed, and am very grateful to you and him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Friend</span>,</p>

<p class="pi12">By the time you receive this, I hope
that the portrait of Dante, for you, will be in London.</p>

<p>The gentleman who has taken charge of it was in such
haste to leave the country (from the consequences of a fatal
duel) that I had not an opportunity for writing.</p>

<p>You will receive, in fact, three portraits. They are as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>No. 1. A drawing in chalk, on light-brown paper, of the
face as large as the original. I had intended to write a
memorandum on it, but in my hurry it was forgotten. Perhaps
you would have the kindness to add it, if you think it
worth while&mdash;viz.</p>

<div class="limit2">
<p class="pin1">“Drawn by S. K., and traced with talc, on the original
fresco by Giotto; discovered in the Chapel of the
Palazzo del Podestà, Florence, on the 21st July
1840, before it was retouched.”</p></div>

<p>No. 2. A small sketch in water-colours, giving the colours
of the dress, and the heads supposed to be of Corso Donati
and Brunetto Latini.</p>

<p>No. 3. A Lithography by the painter and restorer Marini,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
who uncovered the painting. This is made on a tracing by
himself.</p>

<p>I thought it useful to send you these in order to give you
a better idea of this very interesting discovery&mdash;Dante, under
30 years of age. With respect to No. 1, it is fixed with glue-water,
and will not rub out with common usage. The only
thing it is liable to is the cracking or bending of the paper,
which sometimes in a face alters the expression.</p>

<p>Since I drew it, I have had the mortification to see the
original retouched, and its beauty destroyed. You will perceive
that the eye is wanting. A deep hole in the wall
was found exactly on that spot, as if done on purpose. It
was necessary to fill it that it might not extend further: not
content, they ordered Sig. Marini to paint the eye on it, and
he has daubed over the face in many parts, to the ruin of
its expression and character. It is now 15 years older, a
mean, pinched expression, and an effeminate character,
compared to what it was. It is not quite so bad as the
lithography I send you, but not far from it. When I saw
what was done, I asked a young man, his assistant, if it was
done with colours in tempera, and he assured me, with a
boast, that it was in bon fresco. If so, Dante is gone for
good. But I have still hopes that he spoke only of the
eye, and many of my friends think it can only be accomplished
on the old and hard painting by some distemper-colour
of glue, size, or egg; and, if so, a damp cloth fixed
on it for half-an-hour will bring it all away without injuring
the original fresco. I mean to take my time, and perhaps
some day I may restore Dante to himself a second time.
I had the principal part in the late discovery.</p>

<p>The lithography I send you is exceedingly unlike and
incorrect, although a tracing. In shading and finishing he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
has totally lost and changed the outline, if he ever had it.
It is vulgar, old, and effeminate&mdash;the contrary in every respect
to the original. The Florentines of to-day cannot draw, nor
even trace. Think of what such a hand would do, if allowed
to paint over it! and that has been the case. It is a misfortune
when the direction of the fine arts is in the hands
of an ignorant man, chosen only for his <i>Nobility</i>! Our
Direttore with his cleaners has been the ruin of paintings in
the Galleries, since I have been here, to the value of £60,000
or £80,000 sterling&mdash;and the money is the least part of
the loss. When I mentioned to you that my drawing was a
secret, I only meant that, if known here that I obtained
access to make a tracing by bribery, it would compromise
those who had assisted me. You are welcome to show it
to whom you please, and <i>do whatever you wish with it</i>. But
I recommend you not to give it away, for it is the <i>only</i> copy
that has been made to my knowledge before the fresco was
retouched, except the miserable lithography which I send;
and, if so bad a copy was produced by the help of tracing,
and from the original in its pure state, nothing very good
is to be expected in future. The eye in the said lithography
was, of course, added by the copier. You will perceive by
my drawing that the outline (the eyelash) remained, which
was fortunate, as it gives the exact situation of the feature.</p>

<p>We are in daily expectation of the arrival of The Book
of Mystery.<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> I am doubly anxious, from the distinguished
honour you have conferred on me. The Marquis and the
Professor are full of gratitude to you, but the Frenchman
(<i>entre nous</i>) seemed to confer a favour rather than receive
one. And so great a one! <i>Gente francesca!</i></p>

<p>Do you know the Improvisatore Regaldi? and his <i>Carme a

<p class="pr2 p1"><span class="smcap">Florence</span>, <i>5th February 1843</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Friend</span>,</p>

<p class="pi12">Let me add my thanks to the rest of
the world for the mental enjoyment afforded by your <i>Beatrice</i>.
My share is the greater for the handsome and honourable
mention you make of me. I am proud of your approbation
and good opinion, and am doubly grateful for the rank in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
your esteem which you have so generously bestowed on me.
The book has met with unusual success here. It has converted
many. Whether the name has attracted the public,
or the compactness has excited the idle, or the cheapness
the economic, or all together, I know not, but it has been
much read and admired. Italians and Tramontani are all
full of it. I think in general they are grateful for the light;
although it destroys a romantic illusion, which has been
much cherished, especially on this spot, but which they
cannot now entertain, except at the expense of adhering to
an absurdity, or rather many absurdities. Some, however, are
too far committed, and have too much vanity to acknowledge
themselves wrong&mdash;the vulgar and the selfish in particular.</p>

<p>For my own part, I have found the Ragionamento in part
a renewal and condensation of what I had already learned
from your former works, divided and spread through them.
In this first Ragionamento you have not given the demonstration
(I suppose it will follow in a succeeding one) of
Boccaccio’s fault respecting May-Day, which is so complete
and curious in the <i>Misteri Platonici</i>....</p>

<p>The most important of your decisions is confirmed and
strengthened in this volume: I mean your identification of
Beatrice and Filosofia. Your three reasons at the top of
p. 20 are new and unanswerable. How completely Dante
blindfolds the superficial reader (which I was, till you
taught me to fathom him) by making one believe that the
lady at the window was <i>mundane philosophy</i>, and that Beatrice,
or <i>Divine Science</i>, reproaches Dante in Purgatory for having
yielded to her attractions for a short time....</p>

<p>I am so engrossed by your work that I am carried away
and not answering your very kind and most friendly letter.
A thousand thanks for it. I know how your time is filled,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
and have always wondered how you can get through all. I
fear even writing you, but you desired me to send you all
I think of <i>Beatrice</i>. My letter would be long indeed if I
touched on all its beauties: I should copy the book. There
are many additional discoveries in the weaving of this mystic
web which the book is rich in. You still surprise those
whom you have already convinced. You are certainly an
extraordinary Unraveller&mdash;a Disentangler&mdash;and I will say
that, notwithstanding the dry task of unpicking knots, tight-drawn
on purpose to resist skill and force, you have performed
it with a skill and elegance that render it exciting
and delightful to follow.</p>

<p>You desire all my “opposizioni.” Lord help me! Can
I find an error or two of the press?...</p>

<p>I am longing for the next Ragionamento; I don’t know
if others want much more to convince them, but in general
the first part seems to have had that effect.</p>

<p>Mr Lyell judges me, as you do, too partially. All I have
learned I owe to you; and I confess to you that I have
often found it difficult, even with your powerful help, to
remove the substantial screen which Dante has built up
<i>purposely</i> to conceal and protect his secret. But, when I
think of you, who have, alone and single-handed, knocked
over so many formidable barriers, and shown us the gardens
and roses, the groves, the apples, the laurels, the olives, the
flowers, the stags, and all the magic machinery of secret
romance, I am lost in thinking how you found your way
in such a labyrinth, and what immense and curious courses
of reading you must have gone through, turning all you
obtained to the accomplishing your will and determination
to penetrate an untrod region, without a track or vestige to
guide you. I wish I had the ability to write a description<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
of your <i>Misteri</i>. Perhaps I could be of use in lending a hand
merely, as I have studied them much; but <i>my</i> tools are
paint-brushes, and I am not practised in the art of writing.
My education has been too defective for me ever to have
ventured in print. A weak defender is more dangerous than
a strong opponent, and all I could hope would be perhaps
to hit on some thought that might have escaped others;
but without some help from the third heaven (which a good
friend of mine knows of) I should not be able to clothe it
so as to render it decent.</p>

<p>I observe what you say on the subject of necessary reserve
on certain subjects. You are quite right. You cannot be
too careful in your situation and with your family. From
your letter I see that your opinions are nearer mine than I
supposed. But, as I am living out of the world and am
perfectly free from it, I can safely be as explicit as I please.
I have no reserve, and, if ever <i>the</i> cause require a word
beyond the customary and necessary limits, call upon me
to say it, or say anything for me against priestcraft and kingcraft.
That is my religion.</p>

<p>I don’t wonder at Mr Lyell’s exultation at your <i>Beatrice</i>.
There are some master-touches amongst the new proofs,
both in matter and manner, both close reasoning and
light....</p>

<p>The three pomegranates in Giotto’s fresco are so uncertain
in their appearance, from injury and time, that I was doubtful
about them, but a word from you decides the question in
my mind. They are chipped and much obliterated; and, from
their seeming a sort of double outline, and no shade or
colour but the yellow drapery on which they are painted,
I took them for an embroidery on the breast of the Barone.
Some remains of fingers and stalk, however, had led the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
Florentines to consider them as melograni, and they were
puzzling their brains to find a meaning....</p>

<p>Your whole-length portrait of yourself is full of nature and
character, and therefore it must be very like: I thank you
for it. And here is mine:&mdash;a little thin old man, 54, formerly
dark, now very grey. Fond of fun, but not often tempted
to indulge in it, and seldom depressed. Living alone in an
old tower with two dogs only&mdash;a servant coming daily for
a few hours. Disliking much to go into company, and
especially to dress in cold weather, being slovenly even in
my younger days. I live very temperately and never take
wine. I am very active, more from lightness than strength,
for I feel the effects of years and illness. Just now I boast,
for I have had extraordinary health this autumn and winter.
I paint a little, and read a good deal. I ought to do more
in both, with opportunities and perfect liberty, but I am slow
and stupid. My memory, too, is weaker than it was.</p>

<p>Lord Vernon has twice desired me to present his best
compliments and remembrances to you. He hopes you have
received his book (through Molini). There is an outline in
it from my tracing of Dante’s head, and, though it is not very
correct, it is the best yet done....</p>

<p>When will your new edition of <i>Iddio e l’Uomo</i> come out?
I admired it much in its former state. Forgive the length of
this letter, and remember me to Eastlake and Keightley.</p>

<p class="pc1 lmid"><span class="smcap">No. 4.</span>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Letters (or Extracts from Letters) from
Giuseppe Mazzini&mdash;Eleven to Rossetti, and one
to another Correspondent</span></p>

<p class="p1">The following are the only letters from Mazzini that remain
among my father’s papers&mdash;except some other three or four,
too trifling to be printed. The originals are naturally in
Italian; the translation is mine. Letters A. and B. relate
to a certain Galassi and Vantini, whom I do not remember,
but the letters explain themselves well enough. Mention is
also made of a “little book” by my father, which was <i>Rome
towards the Middle of the Nineteenth Century</i>. Letters C, D,
and E, refer to a school which was got up in London, by
some leading resident Italians interested in the lot of their
fellow-countrymen, for the instruction of the poorer and
hitherto much neglected members of the colony&mdash;organ-grinders,
plaster-cast vendors, models, waiters, journeymen, etc.
The ice-cream purveyor did not exist at that remote date.
This school, held in the Hatton Garden quarter, went on
for some few years, dignified by the countenance of Mazzini,
and greatly indebted to the practical work of (among others)
Filippo Pistrucci, who was a painter, teacher, writer, and
improvisatore, brother of the celebrated medallist. Rossetti
of course concurred, but without taking any very active part.
Letters F, G, and H, refer mainly to a MS. which my father
wished to send to Paris&mdash;being, I take it, the selection of
his poems, many of them youthful, which were published
at Lausanne, under the title <i>Versi</i>. There is also some
mention of the Conte Giuseppe Ricciardi, named on p. 91
of the present book. He belonged to the Mazzinian sect,
but sometimes kicked against the traces, and one can see
in the correspondence that the great chief found him on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
occasion a little exacting and tenacious. Letter I has reference
to a <i>fête</i> which Signor Giovanni Antonio Delavo, who
had erected a villa on the site of the Battle of Marengo,
got up on the anniversary of the conflict. He had induced
my father to write a poem for that commemoration; and
Mazzini, it seems, was invited to obtain the insertion, in some
English newspaper, of the poem, or of some other writing
connected with the occurrence. In this letter, and in the
following one (J), the observations about political events
deserve notice. The final letter (K) seems to belong to a
late date in 1848, and to imply that various Italians, including
Mazzini himself, had addressed the Swiss Diet in consequence
of some complications arising out of the Italian military
reverses, in conflict with the Austrians, towards the close of
that memorable year of unmeasured hopes and cruel disappointments.</p>

<p>A few notes of my own on minor points are appended to the
correspondence.</p>

<p>Besides the eleven letters to my father, I give one letter,
of far larger purport, which is quite unconnected with my
family. It was lately purchased by a daughter of mine, simply
as an autograph. On the purport of this document I need
not enlarge, as it speaks for itself. It stands numbered at
the close “15” in Mazzini’s handwriting, and would seem
therefore to be one missive in a sustained correspondence.
The recipient (or some one) has written upon it in Italian,
“Letter from Giuseppe Mazzini”; moreover, the peculiar
handwriting is quite unmistakable. It bears no date, and,
for reasons readily surmisable, no postmark. In the course
of the letter the addressee is spoken of as “My Corso”:
I presume, therefore, that his surname may have been Corso,
but this <i>might</i> also be a Christian name, or might merely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
mean “Corsican.” A name is written by Mazzini on the
back of the letter; it has been partly inked over, and looks
to me more like “Mr Clare” than anything else.</p>

<p>The letter shows that the addressee had some relations with
Vincenzo Gioberti, the celebrated Churchman and Minister of
State, whose leading work, <i>Il Primato d’Italia</i>, was published
in 1845. Perhaps 1846 or thereabouts may be the date of
the letter. It mentions Tommaseo, a multifarious man of
letters, whom English people may remember as having
written the inscription on Casa Guidi, Florence, for Mrs
Browning; Buonarroti, a member of the house of the great
Michelangelo; and Bozzelli, the Liberal politician in Naples,
who came to precarious power in 1848. My father has
mentioned him on p. 98. Libri appears to be the Librarian
of that name, settled in Paris, who succumbed under a charge
of serious frauds. The names of Malmusi and Bianco are
not recognized by me.</p>

<p class="pr8"><i>28th March 1841.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Signore Rossetti</span>,</p>

<p class="pi12">You warmly recommended to Vantini
one of our brother exiles, Galassi. You recommended him
for some employment, and that is well. But to discover
an employment is a lengthy affair, and Galassi has not a
halfpenny in the world, and I, for the last month and a half,
have been assisting him so far as my means allow&mdash;or indeed
<i>don’t</i> allow. However, an expedient has offered, equally
acceptable to Galassi and to us&mdash;that of sending him to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
Spain. What between the friends that he has there, and
others whom we could obtain for him, and his knowledge
of the language, and other points, he would not find it
difficult to procure occupation; here, not understanding,
nor perhaps making himself understood, he would not succeed
in a hundred years. Also a ship has been found which would
convey him to Bilbao or Santander for a sum of £5; so
that, with some few other pounds to get along with at the
first start, Galassi might have a chance of better fortune.
Now the ship will leave on the 30th of this month, and
I can and will do my share&mdash;not the whole. Therefore I
appeal to you and to other good Italians. And from you,
as being better than many others, I wish for two things instead
of one; I would like that, if you <i>can</i>, you would inscribe
your name for some shillings on the accompanying subscription-list&mdash;and
that, if you <i>will</i>, you would write off to Vantini,
informing him that your client is preparing to depart, and
does not need to be assisted save this one time, and you
would send on the list to him. Vantini is indeed one of
the best-hearted of them, and this I know by experience. I
would myself write to him, but have recommended so many
to him that I dare no more. Besides, it seems to me better,
since <i>you</i> made the beginning, that you should bring this
good work to a close. None the less, I shall be grateful
to you, as if you undertook it now, and solely for my sake.</p>

<p>Meanwhile I am greatly obliged to you for the little book
you sent me; good and useful. We perhaps do not wholly
agree as to the remedies to be applied to our Italy; but
certainly we do agree as to her wounds, and you do a beneficial
work in laying bare unremittingly one of the most
pernicious. For the rest, I trust in God that one day we
shall understand each other, and that you will be unwilling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>

<p class="pi12">I have managed with Vantini through a

and for what you did for my client.</p>

<p>If you will send an order to Rolandi to deliver, to some
one on my behalf, a certain number of copies of your booklet,
I will send them, four days hence, by an opportunity to Spain.
At present I have no opportunity as to Switzerland, but I
have correspondents there; and, were the chance to present
itself to you sooner than to me, address to Signor Fanciola,
Postmaster at Locarno (Ticino) for “Signor Pietro Ol&mdash;&mdash;”;

of you would be no more than the influence of your name
among the Italians who know you. The object is to have
you as our brother in our Association, so that to any inquirer
one could say&mdash;“All those who truly love the cause of their
country have comprehended that unity of country cannot
be founded without unity of association.” There would be
a slight monthly contribution fixed by yourself; there would
be (and this is the most serious condition, but, as you will
see, inevitable) the certainty that, in writing about our country,
you would leave off recommending monarchic constitutionalism,
and repeat with us: “May God and the People be the
salvation of Italy!” And these, for us who are abroad, are
about the only conditions of the Association. For the rest,
I believe that a copy of our <i>General Instruction</i>, given to you
by Pistrucci, has remained in your hands. The whole of our
thought is there expressed; and, if one day you feel able to
say “I accept it and make it mine,” you will be received
by us with joy and sincere brotherliness.</p>

and I want to request her to sing: singing for a school is
quite a different thing from singing in a theatre. I know
that she at one time asked Giannone<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> for a letter to you,
and that you saw her. I don’t know on what terms you have
remained with her, but, knowing <i>you</i>, I presume good terms.
Could you add a letter to the one which I hold? or could
you join me in a visit? or, if nothing else, write to her on
your own part?&mdash;and, in this last case, on Monday or Tuesday.
Thus assailed at one moment from two sides, she would
perhaps surrender.</p>

<p>Whatever you decide, please oblige me with a couple of
words in reply, and with the lady’s present address,<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> if you

the end of the month. We cannot, for exhortations and

who consider they have stretched a point if they accept letters,

I undertake, for love of you, to get all the things off, but

<p class="pi12">To your MS. has happened what often
happens to our Italian affairs: in trying to do good, one
does harm. If we had waited patiently for that Italian
traveller of mine of the 24th January, the MS. would at
this date be in Paris. But, urged on by my own wishes,
and also by the strong pressure, I seized the opportunity of
an Englishman, Captain Boulton, and consigned the volume
to him. He, as he said, was to leave on the following day.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
And, knowing nothing to the contrary, I supposed him to
have departed, in fact; until, five or six days ago, becoming
suspicious from the silence of my correspondents, and
making active quest for the officer, I found that owing to
some family incident or other he had deferred his departure,
and had indeed gone off to the country&mdash;whence he writes
that he will be leaving in seven days!!</p>

<p>You should, therefore, be under no alarm for the MS. Like
yourself, I regret the delay, but it is not my fault. If, earlier
than the seven days, I get an opportunity, I will see that the
MS. goes off before the officer; if not, not.</p>

<p>I felt anxious to reply to you about the MS., as the matter
of most importance. As to Ricciardi’s eight copies, please
inform Ricciardi that one can’t tell a tourist, “Take with you
a boxful of things”; that it is a miracle if I found some one
to convey the eight; that, sooner or later, I shall find some
one to convey the others; and that moreover I would not
have undertaken, except for wishing to do a service to you
whom I greatly esteem, to send off either the eight or the
sixteen. Neither would I set going from Paris to London,
and then from London to Paris, copies of my own performances,
but would order them to be burned or given away.</p>

electoral movements, literary articles already promised, etc.,
form the pretext. The true reason, I think, is that the
apotheosis of Napoleon has no grateful sound to English reminiscences.

in the face of Austria by every means: the rabbit will not
be changed into a lion. I say rabbit, and might say fox.
To celebrate Marengo, a battle won by an Italian but in the
name and under the banner of the French nation, while
we have the Austrians our masters two paces off, savours
to me of bragging rather than of patriotism. I see these
demonstrations with pleasure, because they furnish an occasion
for impressing on the people, who know not, the name
of Italy, and that of her oppressors; but, as an individual,
I feel inclined to smile with a trifle of bitterness. In
Piedmont the rabbit is now in the vein of reaction; and not
only the suppression of the subscription,<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> but that of the

<p>[The reference to Ricciardi’s book follows on more or less
from what appears in two previous letters. The book may
possibly have been a predictive <i>History of Italy from 1850
to 1900</i>, which was published in 1842. This letter, written
in the great year of European revolutions, 1848, belongs,
I suppose, to a very early date in that year; perhaps prior
to the insurrection in Paris, which began on 23rd February.
There had been some disturbances in Milan on 3rd January,
and a rising in Messina from 6th January. On 22nd February
martial law was proclaimed in Lombardy by the Austrians.]</p>

that I evade the discussion, nor that I do not set a right
value on your convictions, or do not care about them. No
indeed; and you are mistaken in fancying that your frankness
of speech could ever offend me. If you but knew how the
religion of truth is the religion for me! and how much any
real conviction inspires me with respect, if not assent! But
this is not a question to be disposed of in a few letters; nor
have I time, beset as I am by a thousand distractions through
my dream of Italian initiative, to enter on a discussion. And,
if I ever have time, I shall compose, I confess to you, a whole
volume&mdash;but I shall never publish it, unless a Republican
revolution should have broken out. For the present, I
understand this latest reaction in favour of Christianity, and
I see it to be necessary, and acknowledge it as useful.
A true knowledge of Christianity&mdash;its nature, its mission&mdash;will
follow from this study. Just as, in my view, <i>reform</i> must
naturally precede the securing of independence, liberty, and
equality, in political dogma, so do I believe that the political
synthesis, or at any rate a glimpse of this synthesis, must, in
the new epoch, precede in renovated Europe the manifestation
of the religious synthesis of the epoch. Rights were of
yore individual; and it was natural that first the <i>individual</i>
should be emancipated, that the <i>instrument</i> should be formed
to acquire an application of those rights in the political
department. At the present time the reverse is the case.
The question is that of the <i>social</i> synthesis. The <i>instrument</i>
is no longer the <i>individual</i>, but the people. Therefore the
people, which is to secure the religious formula, requires to
be <i>constituted</i>: therefore a political revolution before the
religious one.</p>

<p>Only, you know what I have always said: like advanced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
scouts, secret sentinels of human nature, <i>intelligences</i> must
begin to proclaim that they descry the <i>new lands</i> and the
new law. And therefore I should have supposed you to
be among them; and I still believe that you will be among
them later on. Meanwhile, as you think that my efforts
(and be it observed that I am doing nothing) are to subserve
the triumph of Christianity, so do I think that yours are to
subserve the triumph of the new synthesis, the <i>social</i> synthesis,
philosophy merged into religion: because&mdash;I do not deny
it&mdash;my “harmonized dualism” is precisely this harmonizing
of philosophy with religion&mdash;two things which hitherto have
been at odds, and which will end by coalescing. Yours is,
without your perceiving it, an eclecticism and no more. Your
<i>quid tertium</i>, neither <i>catholic</i> nor <i>primitive</i> (two distinctions
as to which I should have much to say), is an Utopia, or
rather a chimera. You don’t perceive that that which you
call <i>primitive</i> is at bottom nothing except Christianity in the
soul, not any social form; that the second epoch&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>
Catholicism&mdash;is rightly the application of Christianity to
society; and that the Reformation&mdash;a cynical movement,
whatever you may say about it&mdash;came, in fact, to say of
Christianity: “You are not susceptible of any social application,
of any national unity, because you are an individualistic
formula and no more: stay you in your proper sphere.”</p>

<p>You and I, I perceive, regard the Reformation, and all
things, from different points of view.</p>

<p>And now see what is the outcome of the idea, “Christianity
is an <i>eternal</i> religion, an unique religious synthesis.” And
what of mankind prior to Christianity? Oh in what sense
do you understand God, if you admit that He gave the unique
eternal synthesis some thousands of years after the race had
been created? And the unity of the mind of God? A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
progressive law at the beginning, and an eternal synthesis
later on? But no more of this; you go too far. Believing
as I do, with yourself, in continuous progression, there ought
to be between us only a question of time, but never a denial
of a new synthesis when the time comes. <i>Christianity asserts
its perfection and eternity as a fundamental principle: therefore
you cannot, without destroying it, say that it is not the
whole of truth.</i> But once again, no more of this. Christianity
had to profess itself perfect and eternal, and I even admit
that. But when did Christianity ever affect to be a social
religion? <i>That</i> is the question. Christianity is the formula
of the individual, and as such is eternal and perfect to my
thinking&mdash;for that formula is what no one can nullify. It
means liberty and equality; and who can ever henceforth
exclude those two bases of progress from the progress of the
future? Christianity therefore will endure. Only, behind
that formula one seeks for another&mdash;the social. Where is
the contradiction?</p>

<p>Tell me, my Corso, with your hand on your heart. To the
arguments which I scatter in my letters, hurried, unconnected,
and almost sportive, the true fruit of profound convictions,
and which you (permit me to say) shirk a little in your replies,
have you anything to oppose? Do not some of the things
which I say, if you think them over seriously, cast some
doubts on your mind?</p>

<p>As to what you cite to me, regarding miracles, and the
resurrection of Christ, etc., I will not discuss to-day; but I
confess to you, it seems to me strange that you should regard
those as being irrevocably proved in history.</p>

<p>I say it seriously, some one will come to furbish up my
ideas, without knowing that I advocated them. I am more
than likely to die without doing this, because I am conscious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
of my mission, and I know the duration of it&mdash;and I know
that it is not I who will wage the war. Truth means to
run her course, and she will do it; but I shall not lay the
foundation-stone of the edifice&mdash;I have no future. I have
discerned, but it is not given to me to do more; therefore
I still devote these my days to a work very inferior to that
which my longings would have sought for&mdash;the actual production
of the instrument. I am neither more nor less
than a political revolutionist, and to this I resign myself.
Would that I may at least be that, and wrench this Italy
that I love out of the mire in which she lies, set her freed
face to face with her destinies, and say to her, “Now make
them yours.”</p>

<p>As you see, I am writing to Gioberti. Writing thus to
all and sundry begins to weigh upon me. I have moments
of <i>spleen</i>, of individualism which rebels; and at those
moments I seem to myself to be playing the prostitute, and
making Italian liberty play the like part. For if you but
knew how many letters, and these to intellects so-called,
and all useless! But these are moments of irritation, arising
out of what I have myself been suffering these three years,
and this is more than you suppose, and you know it not,
and never will know it. Then I return to myself; and,
where I can see any little advantage, any symptom of duty,
I submit and write.</p>

<p>Hand also the enclosed lines to Tommaseo, who, like

<p class="pc1 lmid"><span class="smcap">No. 5.</span>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Six Poems by Gabriele Rossetti</span></p>

<p class="p1">[I give here six specimens of my father’s powers as a poet.
Setting aside <i>San Paolo in Malta</i>, which is only an improvise,
it may be said that in all these instances the verses rank
among his choice things; though many others could be
quoted not inferior. The dates which I give may be regarded
as correct, unless as to the final sonnet, regarding which I
am uncertain.</p>

<p>The lyric, <i>Aurora del 21 Luglio del 1820</i>, was, as I have
before said, extremely celebrated in its time; and the <i>Addio<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
alla Patria</i> has always been an admired piece. The <i>San
Paolo in Malta</i> is referred to at p. 61, and testifies to
Rossetti’s uncommon power as an Improvisatore; being as
it is in <i>terza rima</i>, each rhyme is triplicated, and thus the improvising
effort was all the more arduous.</p>

<p>I leave these poems to the perusal of such readers as
are acquainted with Italian. To try to translate them would
be little else than to scheme deliberately to spoil them.]</p>

<p class="pp6i">Quivi rettile reo mi morse invano,<br />
Che dai sarmenti accesi in cui soffiava<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>Sbucò fischiando e m’addentò la mano;</p>
<p class="pp6i">E mentre a gonfio collo raddoppiava<br />
Il morso in questa man, da me sospinto,<br />
Spense nel foco la maligna bava.</p>
<p class="pp6i">Ciascun credea che di pallor dipinto,<br />
Quasi iniquo omicida a Dio rubello,<br />
Per quel velen cader dovessi estinto.</p>
<p class="pp6i">Ma sopra i giorni miei vegliava quello<br />
Che salvi trasse i tre dalla fornace,<br />
E dai leoni il giovin Danïello.</p>
<p class="pp6i">Ei volle questo suolo asil di pace,<br />
Onde fe’ che per me restasse illeso<br />
Dal tosco d’ogni rettile mordace.</p>
<p class="pp6i">Del portento insperato ognun sorpreso<br />
Mi cadde al piè con supplicanti rai,<br />
Come s’io fossi un dio dal ciel disceso.</p>
<p class="pp6i">E bene al guardo altrui tal mi mostrai,<br />
Chè dalle genti estenuate e grame<br />
Cento pallidi morbi allor fugai.</p>
<p class="pp6i">Di Publio udii le filïali brame,<br />
Sì che a suo padre, in preda a morbo ingordo,<br />
Dell’egra vita rannodai lo stame.</p>
<p class="pp6i">Tolsi a Morte l’acciar di sangue lordo,<br />
Sordi e muti guarii, con tal portento<br />
Che il muto lo narrò, l’intese il sordo.</p>
<p class="pp6i">Corser d’allor ben cento lustri e cento<br />
E sempre questi resi almi confini<br />
Asili dell’industria e del contento.</p>
<p class="pp6i">E vigilando ognor sui lor destini<br />
Nel successivo imperversar degli anni<br />
Scacciai Goti, Normanni, e Saracini.</p>
<p class="pp6i">Farne una rocca contro agli Ottomanni<br />
Disegnai poscia, ne parlai nel cielo,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>E mi fe’ plauso il precursor Giovanni.</p>
<p class="pp6i">Ei che a vittoria del divin vangelo<br />
Proteggeva un equestre ordin d’onore<br />
Che pria regnò fra il Libano e il Carmelo,</p>
<p class="pp6i">Per rinnovarne il pristino splendore<br />
Meco discese per le vie del tuono<br />
Del Quinto Carlo a favellarne al core.</p>
<p class="pp6i">E Carlo allor dal riverito trono<br />
Per compenso di Rodi (ahi Rodi tristo!)<br />
Ai campioni di Dio ne fece un dono.</p>
<p class="pp6i">Ed essi intenti a glorïoso acquisto<br />
Spinser nautiche flotte all’uopo accolte,<br />
Il gran sepolcro a liberar di Cristo:</p>
<p class="pp6i">Tal che in fronte alle turbe infide e stolte,<br />
Che sparsa avean di sè tremenda fama,<br />
L’Ordrisia Luna s’ecclissò più volte;</p>
<p class="pp6i">E sì troncata fu l’iniqua trama<br />
Che la città che le scacciò con l’armi<br />
‘Città Vittoriosa’ ancor si chiama.</p>
<p class="pp6i">Io resi degni di perpetui carmi<br />
Que’ Duci ch’al più Sant’Ordine ascritti<br />
Augusti templi ornar di bronzi e marmi,</p>
<p class="pp6i">E a render più sicuri i patrii dritti<br />
Formar nell’arduo inespugnabil sito<br />
Muniti porti e baluardi invitti.</p>
<p class="pp6i">Io resi industre il popolo imperito,<br />
Tal che per lui nel freddo e nell’ardenza<br />
Lo steril sasso ancor divien fiorito;</p>
<p class="pp6i">E sì lo prosperai di mia presenza<br />
Che, mentre Europa avea miseria e guerra,<br />
Quì fiorivan la pace e l’opulenza.</p>
<p class="pp6i">Io fei cenno da lungi all’Inghilterra,<br />
E commisine il freno a quella destra<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>Che lo scettro de’ mari in pugno serra.</p>
<p class="pp6i">Ed or che il vizio infetta ogni terreno<br />
Melita che virtù non mai discaccia<br />
La virtù sventurata accoglie in seno.</p>
<p class="pp6i">Tu vi discendi: io ti farò la traccia:<br />
Vedrai, figlio, vedrai come a te inerme<br />
Amorosa accoglienza apra le braccia.</p>
<p class="pp6i">Nè l’aspe infausto e il velenoso verme<br />
Temer del vizio all’altrui danno intesi,<br />
Ch’io là distrussi d’ogni serpe il germe.”</p>
<p class="pp6i">Disse, e su me vibrò più lampi accesi<br />
Che in sen mi ravvivâr gli spirti oppressi;<br />
Nella nube ei si chiuse, a terra io scesi,</p>
<p class="pp6i">E sull’ospite sponda un bacio impressi.</p>

Temuto in guerra qual fragor del tuono,<br />
Che, a sua voglia togliendo e dando il trono,<br />
Turba d’imbelli rè spinse all’obblio.<br />
Un trono io m’ebbi; e non mel diede in dono<br />
La sognata dai rè grazia di Dio;<br />
A un nume de’ miei pari, al brando mio,<br />
Terror dell’orbe, debitor ne sono.<br />
Il Destin quì mi trasse, e non l’Ispano,<br />

Of Nicola Rossetti and Francesca Pietrocola, a respected married
couple, I was born in Vasto, a city in Abruzzo Citeriore, in the year
1783. My brothers, all senior to me, were Andrea, Antonio, and
Domenico. The first, admired for his pulpit-eloquence, became a Canon
of the Collegiate Church of St Mary, the principal church in the city.
The other two, endowed with much poetical talent, have left good
evidence of this in their compositions. I had also three sisters&mdash;Angiola
Maria, Maria Giuseppe, and Maria Michele. The first died unmarried;
the other two married.</p>

I had various masters in the first rudiments of literature; but none
was of so much benefit to me as the one who started me in “philosophy,”
and who also nurtured in me the taste for poetry. He was a Regular
Priest of that province, and he died in Naples at a somewhat early age.
I shall always bless the name of Padre Vincenzo Gaetani.</p>

Now on <i>my</i> hands: one specimen forms our frontispiece. I have
spoken of this matter in my <i>Memoir of Dante Gabriel Rossetti</i>, pp. 5 and
6, and I know that my father’s statement concerning it is not exaggerated.
He executed also, towards 1804, a miniature of himself, of which, writing
to his brother Domenico, he speaks in the following terms:&mdash;“A
miniature portrait of myself, the work of my own hand when I exercised
myself much in the fine art which imitates visible truths. I was at that
time fresher-looking, and perhaps rather plumper, and slightly paler;
before the sanguine-choleric temperament obtained the mastery in me
with that vigour which it now displays. All who have seen it aver that it
is truly myself.” This miniature used once to be in the possession of a
Signora Vezzi of Parma: I know not where it may now be.&mdash;W.</p>

The Marquis who brought me to Naples was Tommaso, of the famous
and very ancient house of D’Avalos, which was transplanted from Spain
to Italy. [It was the same family as that into which the sixteenth-century
poetess, Vittoria Colonna, beloved by Michelangelo, married.&mdash;W.]</p>

Joseph Bonaparte (I need hardly observe) was not strictly a Frenchman.
He was a Corsican, of Corsican or Italian parentage, born before
Corsica had become a French possession. He was thus an Italian, naturalized
as a Frenchman.&mdash;W.</p>

My first volume of poems, printed in Naples in 1807, was dedicated
by me to Baron Giovanni Avalloni, who, upon hearing me recite some of
the compositions, voluntarily offered to have the whole of them printed.
That volume, which was never re-issued, must have become very scarce.
[I possess an imperfect copy of it. The poems&mdash;some of them poor,
and not any exactly good&mdash;deal partly with national events, and this
naturally in a spirit conformable to the Napoleonic <i>régime</i>. There are
some strong animadversions on the Bourbon monarchy.&mdash;W.] My dramas,
written for the Theatre of San Carlo, were printed at the time; were they
collected together, they would make up a volume.</p>
<p class="pfc4">King Joseph and King Joachim have been depicted by grave historians,
and I will not add anything regarding their public and private character.
But, for truth’s sake, I may say that here in London I was very well
acquainted with Joseph Bonaparte, after he had returned from America
in 1831, and that I found many personal gifts in him to admire. In his
house I saw a good deal not only of him but of his brother Lucian, his
nephew Louis (the present President of the French Republic), Lucian’s
daughter Lady Dudley Stuart, with whom I became intimately acquainted,
and who, at the baptismal font, gave her own name, Christina, to my
younger daughter. I might say that I have known all the members of
that renowned family, either in Naples or in London, except the great
Napoleon, whom I never saw. Joseph was kind-natured and cultivated
in mind; but in Naples, spoiled by courtiers, he was a bad king. One
evening, while I was improvising in his house, his daughter, Princess
Charlotte, made a pencil sketch of me, and she sent it me framed as a
present: I still preserve it. [I also have preserved it, and have given
it to my youngest daughter.&mdash;W.] I could here relate many dialogues
which I had with Lucian, his son Pierre, etc., and with the present French
President. But I will only say that Lucian was a republican, but with
many prejudices, and the present President was and is of a character all
puffed up with ambition. Never did I hear from his lips a single word indicating
a liberal spirit.</p>

One may suppose it to have been at first a <i>very</i> subordinate post;
for the pay, I find, was only 15 ducats a month, which appears to be
£31, 2s. 6d. a year. Later on it was 28 ducats a month.&mdash;W.</p>

Of the very many incidents which occurred to me in the Royal
Museum, and which might furnish matter for anecdote, I will state in
prose the following. In the year 1816 [it must have been in 1819, that
being the year in which Charles IV. died.&mdash;W.] there came to Naples
Charles IV., ex-King of Spain, elder brother of Ferdinand, King of Naples.
The latter had also been numbered as fourth; then in Sicily he became
third, and finally, on his return, he was declared first; and in his island-kingdom
this epigram, almost prophetic, had been neatly made upon
him:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pfi8q p1">“Fourth thou wast and now art Third:&mdash;</p>
<p class="pfi10">By subtraction’s rule I’m taught&mdash;</p>
<p class="pfi8">Second&mdash;First&mdash;may yet be heard,</p>
<p class="pfi10">Till at last remains a nought.”</p>

<p class="pfn4">When King Charles came to visit the Museum&mdash;announced by a formal
dispatch, the beating of drums, and a call to arms by the piquette stationed
at the gate&mdash;we presented ourselves to receive him, with Cavalier Arditi,
Director-General of the institution, at our head. The first section which
is ordinarily inspected there is the collection of statues in marble and
bronze, both Latin and Greek&mdash;a most important department on the ground
floor, entrusted to my custody. Thus it became my work to show first
those admired treasures to the Spanish monarch, who spoke Italian very
fairly. In the discharge of my office I pointed out to him the leading
objects; and I recollect that in the first portico I stopped before the statue
of Trajan, and I referred to his rare excellences, saying that he had been
the honour of the Roman Empire and of the Spanish nation. “What,
was Trajan a Spaniard?” he exclaimed with surprise. “Certainly, your
majesty, if Suetonius and other historians did not deceive us.” [<i>N.B.</i>&mdash;“Suetonius”
appears to have been a random shot; he has left us nothing
about Trajan.&mdash;W.] He visited the three porticoes and the five galleries,
and showed much pleasure in my explanations. Having gone through the
whole, I said that others would have the honour of showing him the picture-gallery,
the Etruscan vases, the bronze implements, the collection of papyri,
and the immense library, which were kept in the upper apartments. He
said in a determined tone, “Come yourself.” I felt much embarrassed
in obeying, because I knew how jealous were Don Giuseppe Campi, Canon
Jorio, and others, if any one encroached on their departments, and especially
on so solemn an occasion; but I made a bow and obeyed. He
remained on that long visit upwards of four hours, and, highly satisfied,
he left. The following day, towards the same hour, a fresh beating of
drums and a fresh call to arms announced a visitor of importance. It was
again the King of Spain. On his arrival I alone received him, as neither
Cavalier Arditi nor any one else had been apprised by a dispatch, as on
the preceding day, of this unexpected visit. Entering my small apartment,
he asked for a seat, which I at once gave him. He sat down, and affably
added, “Sit down also,” and, seeing that I hesitated, “Sit down, sit
down,” he repeated. He said that he had returned to re-inspect some of
the objects which had most struck him the previous day, and chiefly the
Emperor Trajan&mdash;adding: “Now that I know he was a Spaniard, tell
me all you know about him.” And I failed not to inform him that that
Emperor, elected by the unanimous vote of the Roman Army, was surnamed
Optimus; and that after his death, at the election of every new
Cæsar, the senate installed him in the Empire with the salutation, “Sis
bonus ut Trajanus, sis felix ut Augustus.” That on his accession to the
throne he entered Rome on foot, to denote his disregard of worldly pomp;
that, confident in the love of the entire nation, he abolished the offence
of high treason; that he embraced any persons who came to visit him, and
had his residence inscribed “Public Palace,” in order that all might enter
without the least scruple, as though the house were their own. In short,
I narrated what history sets down about him. On the third day the King
renewed his visit. He remained alone with me, as on the preceding day,
and, assuming a more confidential tone, he enquired whether I was
married. I replied, No. He then told me that a Congress of Sovereigns
was about to assemble in Verona, at which he meant to claim his throne
which had been usurped by his son, with whom he showed himself very
much displeased. “If I return to Spain, of which I am almost certain,”
he added, “you shall come with me, and I will make you Director of the
Escurial.” “But, your sacred Majesty, so many distinguished Spaniards&mdash;”
“The one who is there now is my enemy, and I mean to dismiss him.”&mdash;“But
I am in employ here, and your august brother&mdash;”&mdash;“Oh, I spoke
to him about that last evening, and he will willingly concede you to my
wishes.” I bowed, and thanked him for so much good-will. But a few
days passed, and Charles IV. lay a frigid corpse in his brother’s palace.
He was a simple, kindly man, given to talking, and he held with others the
same sort of conversation that he had held with me. His right was
manifest, and his son schemed to get rid of him by means of his Minister
Labrador. This was the rumour which then ran through Naples. I could
relate many other anecdotes of what happened to me in the Museum, but
I leave them alone. I will only mention that I elucidated those admired
monuments in two volumes entitled <i>Catalogue Raisonné of the Royal
Museum</i>. In order to give some credit to a young man whom I liked
much&mdash;Giovanni Finati, son of the Controller&mdash;I allowed him to have his
name on the title-page, with the condition that the two volumes should be
printed at his expense, while the receipts from the sale should be halved
between us. After my departure he took advantage of my misfortune,
and wholly defrauded me of that labour of mine. The profits became and
are entirely his; whereas he had no share in the work, except only the
measuring of the statues and busts&mdash;nothing else. [I possess the book in
question.&mdash;W.]</p>

This vigorous tirade against the mighty Napoleon, written in Rossetti’s
old age, is no doubt a true expression of his reasoned opinion, but only of
one side of that. It should not be supposed that he was really blind to the
enormous and many-sided genius of the man; if he condemned, he also
most sincerely admired. See the sonnet at p. 191.&mdash;W.</p>

This poem by Rossetti forms one in a series bearing the following title:
<i>Per la Ricuperata Salute di S. M. Ferdinando I., Attestato di Gioia della
Società Sebezia. Napoli, 1819.</i> Agostino Gallo (named immediately afterwards)
contributed a Sapphic ode. Of course the name Gallo means
“Cock”: Corvo (“Raven,” or bird of ill-omen) is jocularly proposed as a
substitute.&mdash;W.</p>

<p class="pfn4"><span class="ln1"><a name="Footnote_12_12" id="Footnote_12_12"></a><a href="#FNanchor_12_12"><span class="label">[12]</span></a></span>
I have read this ode for the express purpose of discovering what
Signor Gallo objected to, and can only see this. There are certain
stanzas in which the overpraise (too truly termed “flatteries” by the author)
takes the form of remonstrance. The King is told that the nation, in
loving him, do in fact love <i>themselves</i>; that the public happiness demands
that he should be duly careful of his invaluable life; and that, at his age,
he must not persist in incessant hunting.&mdash;W.</p>

Valletta was a lawyer and a poet. “Fair Paloma” was the
Marchesina Luisa Gomez-Paloma, an associate of the Sebezian Society.
The verses (which begin “Parmi vederti ancor quando animata”) indicate

All that I relate here and in the following Canto is strict matter of
fact. The Prince Royal of Denmark, who was afterwards King [Christian
VIII., who came to the throne in 1839&mdash;W.], and is now dead, was
enrolled in the Società Sebezia as an honorary member; and on that
evening when the bust of Torquato Tasso was inaugurated&mdash;a fine work
by Signor Solari of Naples,&mdash;he was seated, along with all the other
Academicians, beside General Naselli, the honorary President. He was
so impressed by my composition (which formed the close of the stately
proceedings) that he said, embracing me, “May I ask a favour of you?
I should like to have a copy of your poem to present to the Princess, who,
owing to indisposition, was not able to come this evening.”&mdash;“I shall
attend to it immediately, and to-morrow you shall receive it.” That royal
couple was held in the highest esteem by all. The Prince, a man of
masculine and imposing presence, had fought with signal courage against
the French, especially in the forests of Norway. The Princess, a lady of
extreme grace and beauty, was universally admired and praised. Next
morning I rose early and copied out the poem; and hardly had I completed
the work (rather a long one, 54 octaves) when I received a note from
Baron Jubar, the Prince’s majordomo, to remind me of my promise, and
invite me to dine with the royal couple the following day. At table were
all the foreign ambassadors, and other diplomatists. This occurred, so
far as I recollect, towards the beginning of 1820. The Prince invited me
various times; and about the end of that year&mdash;when the revolution and the
King’s departure had already occurred&mdash;one evening after dinner he called
me aside, and said: “As it is our intention to pass the rest of the winter
in several cities of North Italy, would not you come with us, to instruct
the Princess in your beautiful language?”&mdash;“But, your Highness, I am
here employed.”&mdash;“I have already spoken to the Minister of the Interior,
who will grant you leave for six months.” A fierce lightning-flash seemed
to strike my mind, and I comprehended that the King was betraying us.
The Prince, cautioned through some diplomatic channel to quit Naples
(as in fact he did), wished to withdraw me from that political danger
in which he perceived me to be greatly entangled. With these sinister
thoughts, I replied thanking him for an offer which highly honoured me,
and saying that I would soon apprise him of my decision. On the following
day I wrote to him that, in the peril to which my country would soon
be exposed, I should be stained with cowardice if I left it; and that I
therefore felt compelled to decline accompanying him in the proposed tour,
an honour which in any other conditions I would gladly have welcomed.
Nor do I repent of what I then did.</p>

He died in Parma in July 1816, aged forty-three. The paralysis
which killed him had been going on for about a twelvemonth. My father
had himself more than one stroke of paralysis in his closing years.&mdash;W.</p>

I may mention that, besides performing this service under the
Government of King Joachim, Rossetti was enrolled in his National
Guard (or Guard of Internal Security) in Naples. I have a document,
15th December 1814, which shows this. His berth in Rome has been
termed by him elsewhere “a provisional post in the Secretariate of the
Provisional Government, being the post which concerns Public Instruction
and the Fine Arts.”&mdash;W.</p>

Dr Curci, who had a passionate attachment to my father, came to
London to see him towards 1836; Durso also I can remember as having
visited him towards 1840. “Cesare Malpica” is a name I often heard
him pronounce; of Caccavon I am not able to say anything.&mdash;W.</p>

The statements here made about the Principe di Canosa are not
inventions; they will be found confirmed in Colletta’s <i>Storia del Regno
di Napoli</i>, Book viii. Canosa’s scheme amounted (in general terms) to
an attempt to get up in 1816 a massacre of the Carbonari and their
sympathizers, by a hostile sect named the Calderari.&mdash;W.</p>

Rossetti was a Carbonaro; but (I understand) he was not enrolled in
that secret society until the second half of the year 1820, when, as the
constitution had been already granted by the King, there was nothing
illegal in his being a member. The word Carbonaro means literally
“coalman, charcoal-burner”: hence certain technical terms of the sect,
occurring further on.&mdash;W.</p>

Gaetano Vardarelli, with his two brothers, commanded a formidable
band of brigands (who may or may not have been Carbonari): the whole
band was generally called the Vardarelli. In July 1817 the Government
entered into a dishonouring compromise with these brigands; but soon
afterwards, at Ururi, slaughtered the three Vardarelli and others by treachery,
and, later on, others of the disbanded band at Foggia, and the remainder
underwent military execution. A grimly Italian incident accompanied
the massacre of the brothers Vardarelli. One of the brothers had outraged
the sister of a man from Porto-Cannone. This man dipped his hands
repeatedly in the blood gushing from the corpse, washed his face in
it, and cried to the multitude, “L’ho purgata” (I’ve washed it
clean).&mdash;W.</p>

For Capobianco’s judicial murder King Joachim (not Ferdinand) was
responsible; it took place in 1813. Capobianco was a Carbonaro, young,
and of very daring spirit. He was invited by General Jannelli to a public
dinner in Cosenza, well feasted, seized at the moment of departure, and
next day condemned to be beheaded.&mdash;W.</p>

What I state here is matter of general knowledge; and, relating as
it does to public events of that agitated period, it belongs more to history
than to biography. Those authors should therefore be consulted who have
treated of it; among whom I recommend the valuable Memoirs of General
Guglielmo Pepe, who was greatly concerned in the occurrences, in preference
to the elegant History of General Pietro Colletta, who, whether
through mis-information or through distorting envy, is not always a
veracious narrator. I have been intimately acquainted with both these
writers; but more than either I prize sacred Truth; and the little which

This pæan may seem misapplied, considering the rapid collapse of
the Neapolitan emancipation of 1820. That movement was, however, the
first awakening of the Italian national sentiment since 1815, and in
1859 (though Gabriele Rossetti did not live to see it) the great cause had
triumphed. Readers may recollect that Shelley’s <i>Ode to Naples</i> celebrates
in exalted terms these same events of 1820.&mdash;W.</p>

I wrote several patriotic odes for that great event of the revolution of
Naples, and I will here name two, which are introduced into my <i>Veggente
in Solitudine</i>. They begin thus&mdash;</p>

<p class="pfi8 p1">“Sei pur bella cogli astri sul crine”&mdash;</p>
<p class="pfi8">“Fratelli, all’armi, all’armi!”</p>

<p class="pfn4">I also composed more than sixty manifestoes upon various occurrences;
they circulated in print throughout the whole Carboneria, in which I
was a member of the General Assembly; likewise a brochure of some
length entitled <i>Alla Difesa, O Cittadini</i>. This inflamed all hearts, when
the treachery of the perfidious Bourbon King came to be known. [I
possess the brochure in question. It was printed towards the end of 1820,
at the time when Ferdinand I. was still professing to adhere cordially to
the Constitution, notwithstanding the threatening attitude assumed by
Austria. Consequently the tone of the author is highly respectful towards
Ferdinand, at the same time that the nation is urged to prepare energetically
for a war&mdash;possible, though as yet not exactly probable&mdash;against Austria.&mdash;W.]</p>

The house in which I kept needfully concealed for three months
is in the Concordia quarter. Opposite it was a meagre invalid, who
posted himself all day at the window, to peer at whatever was going on
in the neighbourhood&mdash;which prevented me from getting a little fresh
air. One day, from the shadowed inside of my room, I saw that a funeral-car
stopped at his door. I perceived he must be dead, and I was glad
of it&mdash;why conceal the fact? My prying bugbear being gone, I felt more
at liberty, and I wrote for him the following epigrammatic epitaph:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pfi8q p1">“Here lies a man of prying peering art,</p>
<p class="pfi10">Who in other folk’s affairs made endless pother:</p>
<p class="pfi8">And he from this world did at last depart,</p>
<p class="pfi10">Merely to fathom what is done in t’other.”</p>

<p class="pfc4 p1">[I may add that on 18th March 1821, midway between the military
disaster at Rieti on 7th March, and the dissolution of the Parliament on
21st March, Rossetti procured a Neapolitan passport for either Spain or
Malta; but it seems that he never attempted to use it, but lay <i>perdu</i>
instead, until shipped off to Malta by Admiral Sir Graham Moore.&mdash;W.]</p>

It appears that one of these officers was named Stanford. My aunt,
Charlotte Polidori, being in Naples in 1840, knew something of a Mr
Stanford, who (as she wrote) “knew Rossetti well; it was on <i>his</i> arm
that he leaned when, dressed as an English officer, he went on board.
He would have been put to death, had he not left, merely on account of
his political opinions&mdash;on no other subject could a word be said against
him.”&mdash;W.</p>

I remember that, when I set off in the coach between the two English
officers, as we passed before the royal palace to reach Santa Lucia where

a few moments afterwards I found myself in the skiff, and then in the ship.</p>

No doubt this is true; the practice of dictation having been frequently

What I indicate regarding the Right Honourable J. Hookham Frere
is far less than the truth. The life of that admirable and exemplary man
ought to be written. [This was done in publications of the years 1871 and
1899.&mdash;W.] All Malta was full of his munificences, and still resounds his
praise; and, when in the sequel I quitted that island for England, I found
wide-spread confirmation of his repute as a most erudite man, and a genuine
Christian. After being English Ambassador in Spain, he settled in Malta,
with his sister Susan, to watch over the health of his invalid wife in a mild
climate: there he had the grief of losing them both. Oh what excellent
women those were! Early in 1846 he himself, struck by apoplexy, closed
his beneficent life.</p>

The name of Minasi was known to me from boyhood; but I am
unable to say much about him, or to account in detail for the singular
burst of rage and obloquy (here abridged) which my father bestows upon

from the Neapolitan Government, and refugees were prone to speaking of
him as a spy&mdash;as to which, see p. 98.&mdash;W.</p>

This is perfectly accurate. Mrs Rossetti shrank from being eulogized

The reference to “ethics” must be chiefly based on Maria Rossetti’s
religious allegory named <i>The Rivulets</i>, semi-published in 1846. As to
Christina, her volume entitled <i>Verses</i> had been privately printed in 1847,
and the poems which she contributed to <i>The Germ</i> (following a brace

These expressions need not count as an exaggeration. By 1850
Dante Gabriel had exhibited two pictures (one of them now in the

Italian, and some from German, poets.&mdash;W.</p>

The Conte Giuseppe Ricciardi was a prominent Republican politician,
an attached friend of Rossetti. He exerted himself incessantly in the
Italian cause; his death took place towards 1885. Terenzio Mamiani
was an admired writer in verse and prose; Monsignor Muzzarelli a very
open-minded churchman. Cagnazzi (I presume the same person) is
spoken of by General Guglielmo Pepe as the “venerable archdeacon
Luccado Samuele Cagnazzi, a profound and learned economist,” who
became President of the Neapolitan Parliament in 1848. The other
names, Saliceti and Gazzola, are identified by me less clearly than
probably they ought to be. Pepe, the hero of Venice in 1848-9, was
the same who had been the hero of Naples in 1820.&mdash;W.</p>

Bozzelli became Minister of the Interior in Naples in 1848, when
Ferdinand II. pretended to re-commence a constitutional government;
he was afterwards Prime Minister, conniving in the cause of reaction.
During the brief simulation of constitutionalism, General Pepe had much
influence over the Government, and he advocated the recall of Rossetti to
Naples. My father was nearly on the brink of returning thither, with his
family, when the Liberal movement was quenched in blood. The other
minister here mentioned, Borrelli, belongs to the earlier constitution of
1820-21; he was Minister of Police, and persuaded the Parliament to
authorize the departure of Ferdinand I. from Naples; an event which
was pretty soon followed by the repeal of the constitution, and the
proscription of its abettors.&mdash;W.</p>

This diatribe is directed against Sir Antonio Panizzi, whose name is
in the original, given at the close of it: I reduce it here to a comparative
trifle, but have not thought it desirable to miss it out entirely. My father
considered that, for some reason or none, Panizzi had from the first been
ill-disposed towards him; and this feeling was strengthened when Panizzi
published an article (or articles) opposing, and partly ridiculing, my
father’s theories concerning Dante, etc. I am not sure that I ever read
the articles; probably they were bitter (for Panizzi was the reverse of
mealy-mouthed); but, when a man says that Beatrice did not exist, and
that Dante was a sort of Freemason, he must expect that people who
are of a contrary opinion will express themselves forcibly.&mdash;W.</p>

My father lost totally, and very suddenly, the sight of one eye.
After that he was in constant danger of losing also the sight of the other
eye, and he often expected that this would soon be lost. He did, however,

The poem <i>The Seer in Solitude</i> (<i>Il Veggente in Solitudine</i>) has been
previously mentioned. It is true that some of the ideas presented in that

Rossetti here, and in some other parts of the Autobiography, speaks
of himself in an <i>exalté</i> tone, as imbued with a spirit of prophecy, an
instrument in the divine hand for combating despotism, etc. All this
would have seemed forced and presumptuous to a reader of his own day;
yet it was not a mere distempered dream. In less than ten years from the
date of his writing, the thunderbolt had fallen, and Italian despots and
Papal temporal dominion were in the agonies of dissolution.&mdash;W.</p>

This odd-seeming phrase offers no difficulty to the reader of the
<i>Vita Nuova</i>. Dante there says that Beatrice had a special analogy with
the number nine, and was (in a sense) a nine, or a three times three,
whereof the root was the Holy Trinity.</p>

Rossetti’s letter, next before the present one, is dated 13th December
1836. It would seem (looking to dates) that Mr Lyell’s acknowledgment
of being convinced cannot have applied to anything contained in that
letter, but to something in the proofs, then passing through his hands, of
the <i>Mistero dell’Amor Platonico</i>.</p>

<i>i.e.</i> “To remember is a sweet thought, and I rejoice.” My father
proceeds here to quote the entire sonnet, underlining some words, and
offering brief comments. I question whether the English reader would
thank me for reproducing the whole. As regards the other (second)
sonnet which follows, I give the whole of the octave, with comments.</p>

Translation: “As Paul, when he had descended from heaven, could
not speak of the arcana of God, so my heart has covered all my thoughts
with an amorous veil. Wherefore, for joy which I hide in my heart, I
keep silence as to all that I saw and all that I did; and I shall change
the hair on my brow sooner than guilty thoughts shall ever reverse the
obligation.” I have translated the last line in conformity with the
annotation made by my father, which runs thus: “‘Che mai pensier rei
volger possano in me l’obbligo’ to keep silence, as he has said.” I feel,
however, some considerable doubt whether this is the true order of the
words, which are, as a matter of mere construing, anything but clear.
It might be possible to attempt some conjectural emendation in the words,
but I forbear.</p>

These words come from Dante’s <i>Paradiso</i>: “In Rue du Fouarre,
syllogizing invidious truths.”</p>

Mr Taylor was a member of the firm that printed Rossetti’s <i>Amor
Platonico</i>. His book was, I think, <i>Michelangelo considered as a Philosophic
Poet</i>.</p>

By the phrase “your circumstances” Mazzini, I think, refers not so
much to moderate pecuniary means, but rather to the fact that Rossetti,
maintaining himself and his family by the teaching of Italian in private
families and schools, could not with any prudence put himself forward as
a revolutionary agitator. I am satisfied that he did <i>not</i> join the Association
named by Mazzini.</p>

The Conte Carlo Pepoli, a member of an ancient and highly distinguished
Bolognese family, was then a political exile in London. He
ultimately became a Senator of the Italian Kingdom. An epistle in verse
had, in his youth, been addressed to him by the great poet Leopardi.</p>

This must have been a <i>different</i> celebration from that in which Signor
Delavo was concerned. The latter was fixed for 14th May, the anniversary
of the Battle of Marengo.</p>

Mazzini’s word (indistinctly written) appears to be “raccolta,” which
frequently means “harvest,” but may probably here mean “subscription.”
Perhaps it was a public subscription for reinstating amnestied emigrants
in the Papal States.</p>

The Italian word looks something like “compatisci,” which corresponds
to “excuse”; I am not certain about it.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
